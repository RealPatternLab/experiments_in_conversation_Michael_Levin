  "abstract": "Maternal use of anticonvulsants during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an elevated risk of major congenital malformations in the offspring. Whether the increased risk is caused by genetic or environmental risk factors shared by epilepsy and malformations has been controversial. We propose that the bioelectrical control of cell behavior during morphogenesis is a crucial aspect of normal neurotransmission might lead to both better seizure control in the mother and stronger alteration of bioelectric signaling, leading to birth defects in the fetus. Further research in this area would be essential to result in development of pharmaceuticals that do not alter cell resting transmembrane voltage levels coded that safer drugs.",
