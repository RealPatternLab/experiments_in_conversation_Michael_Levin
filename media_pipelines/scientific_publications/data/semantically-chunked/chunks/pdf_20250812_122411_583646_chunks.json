This study analyzes published Boolean network models using a probabilistic generalization of Boolean logic. The continuous nature of this formulation, using Taylor-decomposition methods, reveals distinct layers of nonlinearity.

Understanding biological nonlinearity has implications for theoretical concepts like canalization and control, and practical applications like therapy and synthetic biology.  A key challenge is the mapping between molecular/genetic information and system-level anatomical structure and function, crucial for regenerative medicine and synthetic morphology. System-level properties are often emergent, requiring an understanding of the directness or nonlinearity of information encoding across biological scales.",

The observed linearity optimization in biological networks may relate to canalization and effective connectivity, as previous studies indicate high levels of these measures in biological systems.
