      "text": "PAX5, a transcription factor crucial for B cell development, is frequently mutated in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Restoring PAX5 function can induce remission, suggesting its deficiency drives leukemogenesis. PAX5 shares functional redundancy with its paralogs, PAX2 and PAX8, which are typically expressed in kidney and thyroid, respectively, but not in lymphocytes. This study demonstrates that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 can compensate for PAX5 loss-of-function in ALL cells by modulating PAX5 target genes, restoring differentiation, and reducing replicative potential. Furthermore, hyperosmolarity, at clinically achievable levels, activates endogenous PAX2 and upregulates residual wild-type PAX5 in ALL cells, offering a potential novel therapeutic approach.",

      "text": "Pre-B ALL, a common pediatric malignancy, often responds to chemotherapy but with potential long-term side effects. Differentiation therapy, successful in acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), remains elusive for pre-B ALL. PAX5, a key transcription factor in B cell development, is the most frequently mutated gene in pre-B ALL. Heterozygous PAX5 mutations, including deletions and fusion genes, are common, while germline mutations predispose to ALL. PAX5 activates B lymphoid genes and represses alternative lineage genes like NOTCH1. Loss of Pax5 function, often coupled with Stat5 activation, leads to developmental arrest and leukemic transformation in mice. Restoring PAX5 expression can normalize growth and differentiation in vitro and clear leukemic cells in vivo, highlighting PAX5 as a therapeutic target.",

      "text": "Modulating PAX5 activity directly is challenging due to the \"undruggability\" of transcription factors and limitations of gene therapy or genome editing. However, PAX5's membership in a paralogous gene family offers an alternative approach through genetic redundancy. The mammalian PAX gene family comprises nine paralogs with four subfamilies. The PAX2/5/8 subfamily shares similar functional domains, DNA binding specificity, and exhibits functional redundancy, as demonstrated by mouse gene targeting experiments. While PAX2/5/8 expression overlaps during development, adult expression is largely tissue-specific: PAX8 in thyroid, PAX2 in kidney (with a protective role in hyperosmolarity), and PAX5 in lymphocytes. Since PAX2 and PAX8 are not expressed in lymphocytes, they are unlikely to face the same selective pressures for mutation as PAX5 in ALL. This study explores the potential of PAX2 and PAX8 as functional substitutes for PAX5 in pre-B ALL, focusing on their ability to reverse the developmental blockade and the possibility of activating their endogenous expression through the hyperosmolarity response pathway.",

Subsequent testing of various salts revealed that Na-gluconate, KCl, CaCl₂, and NaCl also induced PAX2 and PAX5, suggesting a role for hyperosmolarity. Downstream PAX5 target genes were also upregulated. K-gluconate and CaCl₂ were chosen for further analysis due to their stronger effects.
