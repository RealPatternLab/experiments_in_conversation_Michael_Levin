This study investigates whole-body bioelectric patterns in immortal (22°C) and aging mortal (10°C) Hydra oligactis using voltage-sensitive dyes.  A consistent bioelectric atlas was established for immortal hydra, revealing a depolarized foot and occasionally depolarized tentacles. Immortal hydra exhibited greater overall depolarization and less sharply defined patterns compared to older, mortal hydra.  These findings establish hydra as a model for whole-body bioelectric imaging and suggest a bioelectric component to aging, potentially opening avenues for anti-aging therapies using electroceuticals.",

Bioelectric gradients of resting potential are crucial for maintaining tissue organization, and their degradation is hypothesized to contribute to aging.

They serve as models for development, regeneration, transplantation, tumor biology, neural and muscle activity, and aging research.

Cold-sensitive (CS) Hydra oligactis are immortal at 22°C but age and die at 10°C, exhibiting age-related physiological declines.
