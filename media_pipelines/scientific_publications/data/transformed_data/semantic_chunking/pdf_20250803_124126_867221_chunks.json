      "text": "Regeneration requires coordination of new tissue with the rest of the body.  This study investigated how injury sites communicate with the body during Xenopus laevis hindlimb regeneration.  Depolarization signals were observed in the contralateral (undamaged) limb immediately after amputation of the opposite limb.  The depolarization pattern correlated with injury position and type, indicating that information about the damage is available to remote tissues and detectable via bioelectric state monitoring. This phenomenon, termed bioelectric injury mirroring (BIM), suggests that regenerative medicine and diagnostics should consider whole-body communication, and that contralateral limbs may not be suitable controls.",
