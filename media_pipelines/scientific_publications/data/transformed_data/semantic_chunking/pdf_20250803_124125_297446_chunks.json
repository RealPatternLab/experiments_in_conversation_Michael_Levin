Drug encapsulation for gradual delivery has opened the doors for a superior treatment regimen. Programming bioelectronic devices to deliver small molecules enables ad-hoc personalized therapeutic profiles that are more complex than gradual release. Here, a wearable bioelectronic device with an integrated electrophoretic ion pump that affords on-demand drug delivery with precise dose control is introduced. Delivery of fluoxetine to wounds in mice resulted in a 27.2% decrease in the macrophage ratio (M1/M2) and a 39.9% increase in re-epithelialization, indicating a shorter inflammatory phase and faster overall healing. Programmable drug delivery using wearable bioelectronics in wounds introduces a broadly applicable strategy for the long-term delivery of a prescribed treatment regimen with minimal external intervention.",

      "text": "Tailoring therapeutic drug levels over time improves treatment effectiveness and leads to better clinical outcomes. Research in drug delivery has developed materials and chemical strategies for passively and actively controlled release. Merging active control with programmable electronic devices can enable personalized and more effective treatment regimens. Bioelectronic devices can deliver on-demand physiological-active ions, small molecules, and electric fields as treatments. This ability is particularly important for rapidly changing environments like wounds. Wound healing involves four overlapping phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. A delay or disruption in any phase can lead to chronicity, scarring, infection, sepsis, and even death. Wearable bioelectronics have employed external stimuli like electric fields and biochemicals to facilitate wound healing. This study developed a programmable bioelectronic device capable of delivering fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), to reduce inflammation and accelerate healing in a mouse wound model. Prior studies have shown that systemic and topical fluoxetine administration improves wound healing in diabetic and non-diabetic rodents, decreases wound pathogen growth, biofilm formation, and infection dissemination.",

The controller module translates a pre-programmed delivery profile into voltage signals, activating the ion pump to deliver fluoxetine to the wound. The ion pump module has two reservoirs containing a fluoxetine solution, connected to the wound bed through glass capillaries filled with an ion-selective hydrogel. The module is made of PDMS. Two Ag/AgCl electrodes connect the reservoirs to the voltage source, driving fluoxetine delivery using VFLX. The reservoir solution is acidic 0.01 M fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX-HCl) at pH 6, making fluoxetine positively charged (FLX+). When VFLX is positive, FLX+ is pushed from the reservoir into the wound bed via the ion-selective hydrogel, which blocks anions. Physiological cations exit the wound bed through the hydrogel on the right, maintaining charge neutrality.

FLX+ treatment resulted in a 39.9% (P<0.05) increase in re-epithelialization compared to control, indicating improved early-stage healing. The actual delivered fluoxetine amount was calculated using the correlation between dose and charge in the ion pump. Due to blood flow and drug half-life, direct wound concentration measurement is challenging; however, the ion pump's characteristics allowed dose quantification based on measured current. Across 15 mice, the device consistently delivered the desired dose. Variability was attributed to system factors like contact resistance changes during movement. This variability allowed a qualitative correlation between FLX+ dose and re-epithelialization. Higher doses correlated with faster re-epithelialization, consistent with topical fluoxetine application. A current control system with closed-loop algorithms could improve precision.",

Considering other indicators (re-epithelialization, macrophage presence, diminishing wound size), the day 3 data corresponds to the monotonically decreasing M1/M2 phase (days 3-5) of the published curve. A lower M1/M2 ratio indicates a later healing stage. The M1-M2 transition is critical for inflammation resolution and tissue repair.

Topical fluoxetine improves healing in diabetic and non-diabetic rodent skin and minimizes infection, possibly by regulating the local serotonin pathway to promote keratinocyte migration and modulate inflammation. Fluoxetine also increases M2 phenotype in microglial macrophages in vitro. These effects contribute to improved skin wound healing. The wearable device provides continuous treatment, limiting patient error and non-adherence associated with self-delivered topical treatments. It minimizes off-target effects due to minimal systemic fluoxetine accumulation or impact on serotonin metabolism. A 7-day positive control with topical fluoxetine decreased re-epithelialization, while bioelectronic delivery increased it by 39.9% at day 3.

The device was tested in vivo on 37 male C57BL/6J mice (15 treatment, 22 control). 6 mm wounds were created, and the treatment group received 6 h of fluoxetine delivery per day for 3 days. Wound area, re-epithelialization, and M1/M2 ratio were evaluated. The device comprises a delivery module (ion pump) and a controller module (PCB, electronics, battery).",

The top layer contained four reservoirs for fluoxetine and four hydrogel-filled capillaries for delivery. The bottom layer acted as a lid with a notch for wound contact. Ag/AgCl wires were inserted into each reservoir. The layers were bonded using oxygen plasma treatment and aluminum pieces. Parylene coating increased media lifetime. Hydrogel-filled capillaries (ion exchange membrane) were fabricated using 1 M AMPSA, 0.4 M PEGDA, and 0.05 M photoinitiator. 100 mm silica tubing was etched and treated with silane A174. The hydrogel was UV-cured, segmented, and loaded with 0.01 M fluoxetine. The capillaries were inserted into reservoirs.",

Voltage and current were recorded, and the solution was collected for analysis. Total charge was calculated by integrating current over time, and fluoxetine dose was calculated by HPLC-MS. Delivery efficiency (η) was calculated. HPLC-MS used a reversed-phase column. A standard curve was generated from known fluoxetine concentrations, and samples were analyzed to verify the fluoxetine peak. Peak area versus concentration was plotted and fitted to a calibration curve. Collected samples with unknown concentrations were analyzed, and their concentrations were calculated using the calibration curve.",
