      "text": "The manual design of soft robots and their controllers is challenging, but automated design tools could augment or replace this process. Machine learning can automate design proposal, testing, and refinement in simulation, with promising designs then manufactured (sim2real). However, preserving simulated behavior in reality is an open question. While prior studies have explored sim2real transfer of control policies, the impact of morphology on the simulation-reality gap remains largely unexplored, partly due to a lack of tools for systematic design and rapid manufacturing. This work introduces a low-cost, open-source, modular soft robot design and construction kit to simulate, fabricate, and measure the simulation-reality gap of minimally complex soft, locomoting machines. The scalability of this approach is demonstrated by transferring a significantly larger number of robot designs from simulation to reality compared to previous methods.",

However, the gap for soft robots remains uncharted. Soft bodies are more challenging to simulate, design, and control precisely, but their inherent compliance makes them more tolerant to inaccuracies. Quantifying which soft robot designs, policies, and behaviors can be faithfully simulated is crucial for both robotics and synthetic biology, as real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and potentially risky. Recent advancements in high-space, many-body, GPU-accelerated soft body simulators have made sim2real more feasible, but their transferability remains unknown due to limited application in physical system design.",
