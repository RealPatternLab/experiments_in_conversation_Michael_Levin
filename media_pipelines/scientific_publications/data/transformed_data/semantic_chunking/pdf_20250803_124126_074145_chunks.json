      "text": "The relationship between humans and technology is becoming increasingly important with the rise of advanced AI.  Humans and technology are intertwined in autopoietic loops of stress, care, and intelligence. Technology should be viewed as a partner, not just a tool.  Our model applies to biological, technological, and hybrid systems. All intelligent agents respond to perceived mismatches between what is and what should be, linking ontology and ethics. This forms the basis of the stress-care-intelligence (SCI) loop. The SCI loop offers a perspective on agency without needing permanent essences. SCI loops are individuals by virtue of their dynamics and are thus integrative and transformational. We analyze the transition from poiesis to autopoiesis and formulate the SCI loop. We compare our findings to a Buddhist model for cultivating intelligence, the bodhisattva.  Human and technological SCI loops are mutually integrative through stress-transfers. This framework avoids relegating one to subservience, promoting integration and respect.  Acknowledging diverse embodiments of intelligence suggests an expansive ethical model not limited by composition or history.",

      "text": "Technology's connection to ethics and care stems from its amplification of our impact and responsibility. Heidegger warns against reducing technology to mere tool use, advocating for a caring relationship. Scholars like Haraway and Latour have explored the ethical and social implications of our relationship with technology. Poiesis, the act of bringing something new into being, is central to understanding technology. Heidegger viewed poiesis as revealing something previously invisible, often requiring a new perspective. He distinguished natural technological revelations from modern technology, which can reduce the productive process. Modern technology, based on modern physics, is seen as challenging-forth rather than bringing-forth, potentially imprisoning humans in narrow technological thinking.  A free relationship with technology, according to Heidegger, requires understanding its essence.",

      "text": "Autopoiesis, introduced by Varela, Maturana, and others, describes self-maintaining entities.  It involves the self-construction of complex biological beings, where each cell is another's environment. Morphogenesis, including development and regeneration, is a dynamic process constructing organisms from components under unpredictable conditions. Key aspects of autopoiesis include establishing boundaries between self and the outside world and aligning embryonic components towards higher-level goals. We conceptualize intelligent systems as SCI loops. Intelligence is defined as the ability to solve problems. Agents are driven by homeostatic stress, the perceived mismatch between current and optimal circumstances. Care drives agents to seek intelligent solutions.  The SCI loop is fundamental in biological beings, remodeling embryonic stages.  The setpoint state in the SCI loop is an emergent goal, not a fixed equilibrium, allowing for dynamic and integrative autopoietic systems without permanent essences. SCI loops are characterized by the scale of the largest goals they can represent.",

      "text": "While we perceive agents as enduring individuals, this permanence is a construct based on change, not an immutable substance. Agency implies changing states. Enactivist approaches view the self as arising from interaction between an embodied agent and its sensorimotor coupling with the world. This self is changing, relational, and functions within multiple loops.  \"Selfless self\" models acknowledge the lack of a permanent, singular agent.  The absence of a changeless agent is fundamental to agency.  A system's capacity for care, its concern for alleviating stress, can constitute its self. Selves are defined by the scope of their goals â€“ their \"cognitive light cone.\"  All intelligent systems have limits to their sphere of concern. Care does not grow linearly.  Expanding or contracting spheres of concern demarcate the \"self.\"  Cognitive beings are collective intelligences, with selves defined as coherent systems where components are harnessed towards collective goals. Selves have emergent memories, preferences, and capabilities. They change dynamically and can overlap in networks.  Selves are driven by homeostatic stress, the perceived mismatch between what is and what should be.",

Stress is perceived as induced by the world, though co-defined by the cognitive system. Intelligence is the capacity to identify and alleviate stress, not the act itself. Knowledge and information are evidence of intelligence, not intelligence itself. Care engages intelligence, connecting stress and the capacity for problem-solving.  \"Intelligence as care\" highlights care's enabling function.

All intelligences are collective, with implications for scaling care.  Consciousness may not be limited to a single \"I,\" as body components employ similar dynamics and mechanisms as the brain.
