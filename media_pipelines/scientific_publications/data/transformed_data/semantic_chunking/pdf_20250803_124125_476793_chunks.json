Neurotransmitters are widely conserved, from evolutionarily ancient organisms lacking nervous systems through man. Here, results are reported from a loss- and gain-of-function survey, using pharmacological modulators of several neurotransmitter pathways to examine possible roles for these pathways in normal embryogenesis. Applying reagents targeting the glutamatergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic pathways to embryos of Xenopus laevis from gastrulation to organogenesis stages, we observed and quantified numerous malformations, including craniofacial defects, hyperpigmentation, muscle mispatterning and miscoiling of the gut. These data implicate several key neurotransmitters in new embryonic patterning roles, reveal novel earlier stages for processes involved in eye development, suggest new targets for subsequent molecular-genetic investigation, and highlight the necessity for in-depth toxicology studies of psychoactive compounds to which human embryos might be exposed during pregnancy.",

      "text": "Although neurotransmitters are most often investigated for their role relaying information throughout the nervous system, they also participate as chemical messengers in many signaling events of a non-neuronal nature. Neurotransmitters precede the appearance of nervous systems on both developmental and evolutionary time scales. Classical neurotransmitters have been found in oocytes and pre-nervous embryos of both vertebrates and invertebrates, including mammals, amphibians, fish, insects and echinoderms. In addition, neurotransmitters are so evolutionarily ancient that they are found in organisms outside the animal kingdom. For example, acetylcholine is present in all kingdoms of life including fungi and bacteria, and serotonin is present in plants. It has thus been hypothesized that the complex cognitive functions occurring in animal brains, and partially mediated by neurotransmitters, evolved from much simpler cell-cell signaling events responsible for developmental patterning and maintenance of homeostasis in primitive organisms.",

For example, the kidney possesses its own dopaminergic system that protects it from oxidative stress and inflammation, and regulates sodium excretion.

Information on involvement of neurotransmitters in pattern formation would not only identify novel components of embryogenesis, but also give important insight into potential new endpoints for teratogenic (embryotoxic) effects of widespread pharmaceuticals. To begin to identify possible patterning roles for other neurotransmitter families, this study took advantage of compounds developed for neuropharmacological research, and an exploratory drug screen was conducted in the Xenopus laevis embryo, a popular vertebrate model for the study of well-conserved developmental mechanisms, as well as for studies of developmental toxicology.

Drugs were dissolved in water or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; if water insoluble), aliquoted and stored at -20 °C until use. Embryos from three-four mothers were mixed and divided into control (MMR) or experimental (MMR + drug at concentrations of 500 пм-500 μμ) groups. Doses were established for each drug on an individual basis as follows. To establish an initial reference point for dosing, literature using the drug in either a cell culture, syaptosome Xenopus oocyte, or mammalian brain slice system was examined. The dose was then adjusted upwards or downwards from the value found in the literature, until a dose was reached at which embryos displayed developmental phenotypes but no increase in mortality or overt toxicity compared with controls. If drugs caused different phenotypes at different doses, all such results were discussed. All doses discussed were within about one order of magnitude of the doses found in the literature: riluzole, 4 μμ; norketamine, 39 μμ; BAY 36-7620, 10 µm; propranolol, 50 µm; nicergoline, 10 μm; cimaterol, 100 μм; and SCH 23390, 10 μμ. Vehicle (DMSO for water-insoluble compounds) levels never exceeded 0.5%, a level that permits completely normal embryonic development. Water was used as vehicle whenever possible. Drug exposures began at gastrulation (Stages 10-11) and continued until Stage 45. If this length of exposure was unable to produce any aberrant phenotypes, an earlier exposure starting at cleavage was tested (2/4 cell-Stage 45). At Stage 45, embryos were imaged on a Nikon (SMZ-1500) microscope with a combination of incident light and transmitted light that best highlighted anatomical features.",
