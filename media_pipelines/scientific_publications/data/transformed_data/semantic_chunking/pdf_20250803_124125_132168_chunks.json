This study analyzes published Boolean network models to understand nonlinearity using a probabilistic generalization of Boolean logic. The continuous nature of this formulation, using Taylor-decomposition methods, reveals distinct layers of nonlinearity in the models. Comparing model-approximations with randomized ensembles shows biological networks are more linearly approximable, possibly due to natural selection for controllability.",

Understanding biological nonlinearity has implications for areas like canalization and control, as well as practical applications in therapy and synthetic biology.  A key challenge is the complex mapping between molecular/genetic information and system-level anatomical structure and function, crucial for regenerative medicine and synthetic morphology.  System-level properties are often emergent, requiring an understanding of the directness or nonlinearity of information encoding across biological scales.",
