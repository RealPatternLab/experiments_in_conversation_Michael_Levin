This study uses a Xenopus embryonic model to investigate how the developing brain controls the innate immune response to pathogenic E. coli.

      "text": "Innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens and initiates adaptive immune responses. Xenopus laevis is a valuable model for studying immunity due to its similarity to mammalian immune systems.  The Xenopus embryo relies solely on innate immunity for the first 12 days, allowing for the study of infection responses without the influence of adaptive immunity.  The bidirectional communication between the immune system and the brain is an emerging field with implications for basic biology and biomedicine.  Cytokines and inflammation-related molecules affect the brain and behavior. Recent studies link immune cells and brain functions in the mature brain, revealing the adult brain's role in regulating adaptive immune responses. The immune system has been proposed as a \"seventh sense,\" informing the CNS about pathogens. Invertebrate models suggest that neural circuits integrate pathogen stimuli via GPCRs to guide the immune response.",
