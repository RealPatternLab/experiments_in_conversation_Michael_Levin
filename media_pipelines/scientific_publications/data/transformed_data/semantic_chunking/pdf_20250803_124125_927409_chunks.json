Fractal aggregation is achieved by replacing each voxel in a basal robot with a copy of itself, repeated iteratively. The Menger sponge serves as an example, where replacing each voxel with a basal sponge generates a fractal sponge. This process can be repeated to create larger fractal structures. The Hausdorff dimension, *H*, quantifies the space filled by a fractal geometry and provides a measure of structural complexity.  Since all fractals in this study have *m* = 3, *H* is proportional to log *c*.  This dimension allows for analysis of how fractals with scale-invariant behavior emerge over evolutionary time.",
