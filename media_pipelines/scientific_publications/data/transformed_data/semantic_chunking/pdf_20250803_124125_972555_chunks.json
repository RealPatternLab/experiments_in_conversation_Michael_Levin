      "text": "Complex living agents consist of cells, which are themselves competent sub-agents navigating physiological and metabolic spaces. Behaviour science, evolutionary developmental biology and the field of machine intelligence all seek to understand the scaling of biological cognition: what enables individual cells to integrate their activities to result in the emergence of a novel, higher-level intelligence with large-scale goals and competencies that belong to it and not to its parts? Here, we report the results of simulations based on the TAME framework, which proposes that evolution pivoted the collective intelligence of cells during morphogenesis of the body into traditional behavioural intelligence by scaling up homeostatic competencies of cells in metabolic space. In this article, we created a minimal in silico system (two-dimensional neural cellular automata) and tested the hypothesis that evolutionary dynamics are sufficient for low-level setpoints of metabolic homeostasis in individual cells to scale up to tissue-level emergent behaviour. Our system showed the evolution of the much more complex setpoints of cell collectives (tissues) that solve a problem in morphospace: the organization of a body-wide positional information axis (the classic French flag problem in developmental biology). We found that these emergent morphogenetic agents exhibit several predicted features, including the use of stress propagation dynamics to achieve the target morphology as well as the ability to recover from perturbation (robustness) and long-term stability (even though neither of these was directly selected for). Moreover, we observed an unexpected behaviour of sudden remodelling long after the system stabilizes. We tested this prediction in a biological system—regenerating planaria—and observed a very similar phenomenon. We propose that this system is a first step towards a quantitative understanding of how evolution scales minimal goal-directed behaviour (homeostatic loops) into higher-level problem-solving agents in morphogenetic and other spaces.",

      "text": "How does the complex anatomical structure of the body form reliably from the activity of individual cells? More than emergent morphogenesis, many organisms are able to reach the same specific target morphology despite surgical injury, changes of cell size or number, organ rearrangement, genetic defects and many other insults [1]. How does the collective decision-making of cell groups enable regeneration, regulative development, metamorphosis and cancer suppression? Answers to these questions are critical to many fields, including evolutionary developmental biology, cell biology and complexity science [2,3]. Beyond their importance for basic science, the ability to control the collective behaviour of cells toward specific anatomical shapes has massive implications for transformative biomedicine. How can we best control morphogenetic systems composed of several levels of organization from cell to tissue, to achieve desired outcomes in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering [4]?",

For example (reviewed in [9,10]), the same mechanisms using ion channels, electrical synapses and computations via bioelectrical networks underlie problem-solving in physiological space by bacterial communities [11,12] and plants [13,14]; navigation of morphospace by a wide range of embryonic and regenerative systems [15–17]; and classical behaviour by organisms with neurons and brains [18,19].",

      "text": "Traditional behaviour science focuses on the cognitive capacities of an ‘individual’—memory, perception, learning, anticipation, decision-making, goal-directed behaviour—and makes two assumptions. First, the body is usually conceived as a fixed structure, following the mainstream paradigm that the genome codes for specific bodyplans. Second, brain structure is thought of as stable—the individuality of its neuronal cells is gone for good. Our primary experience is that of a centralized, coherent self. For organisms like caterpillars, which undergo metamorphosis, with drastic changes of body, brain and behaviour, studies usually focus on their separate phases of life. The transitional states are usually not studied [20].",

Regenerative biology and the development of new organisms like biobots [21] reveal that studies of cognition in intact bodies present just a narrow slice of a much bigger picture: that of the multi-scale interface between body and mind. Indeed, cognition is tightly linked to the physical structure of the body, from the anatomical level to the molecular and bioelectric levels that store its information [20]. And structure and function are both highly plastic. Cognition continues to function despite important changes to the body/brain and the corresponding modification of its information at the cellular, molecular, or bioelectric level [22].",
