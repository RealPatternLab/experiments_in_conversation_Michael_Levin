While the role of ciliary motion in LR patterning at the node during gastrulation is prominent in mouse models, alternative models focusing on cytoplasmic roles of motor proteins have emerged from studies in frog and chick embryos. This study investigates the localization of ciliary proteins in early frog and chick embryos to test the hypothesis that these proteins play cytoplasmic roles in LR asymmetry prior to the appearance of cilia.",

      "text": "The consistent left-right asymmetry of vertebrate organs raises questions about the origin of this handedness. While downstream molecular pathways are being elucidated, the initial steps remain poorly understood. A prevailing model suggests that ciliary motion at the node during gastrulation generates asymmetry by moving determinants extracellularly. This model implicates proteins like LRD, Inversin, Polycystin-2, Kinesin-3B, and Polaris. However, an alternative model proposes that these motor proteins function cytoplasmically to transport LR determinants within cells before gastrulation.",
