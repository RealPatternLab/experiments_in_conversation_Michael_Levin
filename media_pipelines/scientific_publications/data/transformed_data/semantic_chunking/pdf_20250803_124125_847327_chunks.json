      "text": "The question \"what is life?\" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, leading to diverse definitions reflecting the mystery of life's emergence and the variety of disciplinary perspectives. Despite advances in biology, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition has universal acceptance. This challenge becomes more urgent with advancements in synthetic biology, AI, and astrobiology, which challenge traditional conceptions of life. We used LLMs to analyze expert-provided definitions of life, employing pairwise correlation analysis, agglomerative clustering, semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. Our methodology revealed a continuous landscape of themes related to life's definition, suggesting that what has been treated as a binary taxonomic problem should be viewed as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental scientific and philosophical questions, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplines and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitions in science.",

      "text": "Defining life is not just semantics; it reveals fundamental epistemological differences in how experts conceptualize the boundary between living and nonliving systems. Biologists focus on metabolic processes, reproduction, and cellular organization, while physicists emphasize thermodynamics, energy use, and entropy reduction. Computer scientists and complexity theorists prioritize information processing, self-organization, and emergent complexity. These divergent perspectives, shaped by different methods and theories, are hard to reconcile. This definitional challenge becomes more urgent with advances in synthetic biology, AI, and astrobiology, which challenge our understanding of life and have scientific, ethical, and regulatory implications. Some advocate for definitional pluralism, accepting multiple context-specific definitions, but this doesn't address whether deeper coherence exists beneath disciplinary divisions. Others reject binary categorization, suggesting life exists along continuous dimensions. Some even question the utility of defining life at all. We surveyed contemporary scholars for their definitions of life and used manual and computational semantic analysis to examine the responses. Our research addressed the ambiguity by leveraging LLMs to analyze 68 expert answers to \"what is life?\" We used LLM-derived pairwise correlation analysis, agglomerative clustering, and dimensionality reduction to map responses. Our goal is to provide a multidimensional framework for understanding \"aliveness\" that transcends traditional categories and guides ethical and conceptual decisions in our evolving technological landscape.",

      "text": "Ancient civilizations attributed life to supernatural forces like Prana, Qi, Ka, Pneuma, and Ruach, reflecting attempts to articulate a principle separating animate and inanimate matter. Greek philosophy shifted these symbolic conceptions into systematic frameworks of the soul and life. Plato's cosmology in Timaeus views the cosmos as a living, intelligent being, unifying the soul as the principle of cognition and life. Aristotle's teleological approach in De Anima characterized life by functional properties, with a hierarchy of capacities: vegetative (nutrition, reproduction), sensitive (perception, movement), and rational (unique to humans). He emphasized intrinsic purpose (telos), defining life as a self-actualizing system striving to \"partake in the eternal and divine.\" Medieval and Renaissance thinkers preserved teleological frameworks while introducing material explanations. Galen extended Aristotelian teleology through anatomy, while Paracelsus viewed organisms as chemical laboratories governed by an \"archeus,\" bridging teleological functionalism and biochemical form. This tension between teleological and mechanistic perspectives continues to challenge contemporary definitions of life.",

      "text": "Descartes' mechanistic approach viewed the human body as a machine distinct from the mind, shifting focus from teleology to mechanism. Hobbes advanced a materialistic framework, rejecting dualism and reducing life to matter in motion, viewing biological functions as purely mechanical. This mechanistic naturalization of life continued through Gassendi, Spinoza, and La Mettrie, establishing a materialist framework for modern science. However, the question of what distinguishes living from non-living matter persisted. By the 19th century, science reformulated the ancient problem: if life arises from physical processes, what differentiates it from non-life?",

      "text": "The 19th century saw pivotal developments: cell theory, Darwin's evolution, and thermodynamics. Schr√∂dinger framed organisms as thermodynamic systems maintaining order by generating entropy. However, could energetics capture the qualitative difference between living and non-living? The mid-20th century's molecular revolution, with the discovery of DNA and the central dogma, led to information-theoretic definitions of life as computational systems capable of self-replication with variation. Contemporary approaches include thermodynamic frameworks, autopoietic theories focusing on self-organization, the Chemoton model, and NASA's operational definition (\"a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution\"). Despite these advances, tensions persist. Thermodynamic approaches may miss organizational complexity, information-theoretic models struggle with biological meaning, and operational definitions face borderline cases like viruses and prions. Artificial life, synthetic biology, and computational systems further complicate boundaries. Venter's synthetic cell, Levin's work on cell self-assembly, and artificial neural networks challenge assumptions about life's requirements. Systems biology integrates multiple organizational levels, but the question of necessary versus sufficient conditions for life remains.",
