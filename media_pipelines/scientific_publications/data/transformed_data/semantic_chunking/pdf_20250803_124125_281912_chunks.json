This study identifies a new function for KCNQ1, a potassium channel involved in human Romano-Ward and Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndromes. Misexpression of its Î²-subunit KCNE1 in Xenopus embryos alters pigment cell lineage behavior in the neural crest. Depolarization caused by KCNE1 misexpression leads to melanocyte overproliferation, spreading, and invasion of blood vessels, liver, gut, and neural tube, resulting in hyperpigmentation. This effect is mediated by Sox10 and Slug gene up-regulation, linking ion channel function to migration, shape, and mitosis control during morphogenesis. These findings highlight KCNQ1's role in cell behavior regulation and reveal a biophysical switch conferring neoplastic-like properties on embryonic stem cells.",

Bioelectric signals are involved in cell migration, mitosis, differentiation, wound healing, limb development, left-right patterning, neurogenesis, tail regeneration, and cancer. Stem cells possess unique electrophysiological properties and express various electrogenic transporters. Membrane hyperpolarization is essential for myoblast differentiation, while electrical modulation can induce dedifferentiation, suggesting depolarization might promote a more primitive state. The role of electrical signals in stem cell morphogenesis and the transcriptional targets linking bioelectricity to cell behavior remain largely unknown.
