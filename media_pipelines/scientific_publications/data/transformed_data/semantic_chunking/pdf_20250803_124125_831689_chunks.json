      "text": "DNA damage response (DDR) is an important process in ensuring cellular function. Genotoxic stress can cause senescence and apoptosis in proliferating cells or carcinogenesis when oncogenes are affected (Zeman and Cimprich, 2014; Vitale et al., 2017). Upon DNA damage, sensor proteins initiate a DDR that eventually guides DNA repair enzymes to resolve the lesion (Huen and Chen, 2008). The histone variant H2AX is considered a major DNA damage mediator protein because it is used as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions based on its amino acid modifications. H2AX phosphorylated at the 139 serine, commonly known as gamma-H2AX (γ-H2AX), is widely used as a DNA damage marker because it is found aggregated near lesions shortly after they occur (Huen and Chen, 2008; Yuan et al., 2010; Rogakou et al., 1998). Acting in concert to ensure genomic stability, cell cycle checkpoints ordinarily prevent cells from progressing before resolving DNA damage. Cell cycle arrest through activation of DNA damage checkpoints via Chk1 and Chk2 is an important part of the DDR mechanism (Zhou and Elledge, 2000; Bartek and Lukas, 2003; Smith et al., 2010). DNA repair resolves the DDR and protein modifications are reversed so normal cellular function can be resumed (Shaltiel et al., 2015).",

These molecular switches, such as p53, are known tumor suppressors and, when deregulated, apoptosis is circumvented, and carcinogenesis could occur (Lakin and Jackson, 1999). For instance, in vitro cultured human stem cells experience DNA damage and chromosomal rearrangements that change their cellular fate and render them carcinogenic and unsuitable for use in clinical applications in regenerative medicine (Vitale et al., 2017).

Replicative stress and reactive oxygen species generated during the process could challenge regeneration, at the cellular level by inhibiting cell cycle progression or at the functional level by losing the ability to form a proper structure (Sousounis et al., 2014; Al Haj Baddar et al., 2018; Ferreira et al., 2016).",

      "text": "How do amphibians regulate genotoxic stress and DDR while ensuring tissue regeneration? Previous studies have shown that during early phases of regeneration, the activity of p53 is reduced to allow for progenitor cell cycle re-entry (Yun et al., 2013), but it is later activated to enable differentiation (Villiard et al., 2007). Since p53 is a major regulator of DDR, amphibians might be de-sensitized to DNA damage allowing for rapid progression through the cell cycle checkpoints. Their massive genome could also facilitate this process; it has been previously shown that DNA damage is more likely to occur in areas that do not encompass coding regions and regulatory elements, like retrotransposons, which are significantly abundant in amphibian genomes (Poetsch et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019; Nowoshilow et al., 2018; Elewa et al., 2017). A completely opposite (but not mutually exclusive) strategy would entail the initiation of a DDR together with the onset of the regeneration process to ensure rapid DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Studies that have repeatedly initiated the regeneration process, for example when newt lenses were removed and successfully regenerated 19 times over 18 years, support this hypothesis since the structure and function of the genome would remain intact over many rounds of cell division (Sousounis et al., 2015; Eguchi et al., 2011; Sousounis et al., 2014a). In addition, high-throughput gene expression datasets acquired from regenerative tissues show up-regulation of DNA repair genes across multiple organs and animal species, indicating that a proper DDR might be an innate part of the regenerative mechanism (Sousounis et al., 2014; Darnet et al., 2019; Barghouth et al., 2019; Shiroor et al., 2019; Bedelbaeva et al., 2010). This mechanism could occur in conjunction with clearing senescent cells from regenerating tissues, which would allow only resilient proliferating progenitors to be present in the blastema (Yun et al., 2015).",

We found an elevated DDR following limb amputation, which was accompanied by reduced relative γ-H2AX levels and baseline amounts of DNA damage. Then we asked whether DDR is necessary for limb regeneration. To answer this question, we genetically targeted a DDR- and H2AX-associated gene, eyes absent 2 (*eya2*).

We generated Eya2 mutant axolotls and found that their regenerative capability was significantly reduced and their γ-H2AX levels were significantly elevated, especially in cells that have entered the cell cycle. Interestingly, we did not detect accumulation of DNA damage, indicating that our model specifically de-regulated the DDR process. RNAseq analysis of *eya2*⁻/⁻ tissues and pharmacological inhibition of Eya2's phosphatase activity were also used to corroborate our findings. In addition, we uncovered parallel evidence that DDR is required for successful regeneration as inhibiting a separate component of this process, the proper control of the DNA damage checkpoints by Chk1 and Chk2, led to severe regenerative impairment. This study reveals that DDR is an innate part of the regeneration process and identifies Eya2 as a regulator of DDR and cell cycle progression during progenitor cell proliferation. How amphibians regulate DDR and allow for cellular proliferation while maintaining cell fate could reveal important clues for improving the use of human stem cells in regenerative medicine.",
