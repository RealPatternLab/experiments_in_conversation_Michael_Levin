      "text": "DNA damage response (DDR) is an important process in ensuring cellular function. Genotoxic stress can cause senescence and apoptosis in proliferating cells or carcinogenesis when oncogenes are affected (Zeman and Cimprich, 2014; Vitale et al., 2017). Upon DNA damage, sensor proteins initiate a DDR that eventually guides DNA repair enzymes to resolve the lesion (Huen and Chen, 2008). The histone variant H2AX is considered a major DNA damage mediator protein because it is used as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions based on its amino acid modifications. H2AX phosphorylated at the 139 serine, commonly known as gamma-H2AX (Î³-H2AX), is widely used as a DNA damage marker because it is found aggregated near lesions shortly after they occur (Huen and Chen, 2008; Yuan et al., 2010; Rogakou et al., 1998). Acting in concert to ensure genomic stability, cell cycle checkpoints ordinarily prevent cells from progressing before resolving DNA damage. Cell cycle arrest through activation of DNA damage checkpoints via Chk1 and Chk2 is an important part of the DDR mechanism (Zhou and Elledge, 2000; Bartek and Lukas, 2003; Smith et al., 2010). DNA repair resolves the DDR and protein modifications are reversed so normal cellular function can be resumed (Shaltiel et al., 2015).",

      "text": "How do amphibians regulate genotoxic stress and DDR while ensuring tissue regeneration? Previous studies have shown that during early phases of regeneration, the activity of p53 is reduced to allow for progenitor cell cycle re-entry (Yun et al., 2013), but it is later activated to enable differentiation (Villiard et al., 2007). Since p53 is a major regulator of DDR, amphibians might be de-sensitized to DNA damage allowing for rapid progression through the cell cycle checkpoints. Their massive genome could also facilitate this process; it has been previously shown that DNA damage is more likely to occur in areas that do not encompass coding regions and regulatory elements, like retrotransposons, which are significantly abundant in amphibian genomes (Poetsch et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019; Nowoshilow et al., 2018; Elewa et al., 2017). A completely opposite (but not mutually exclusive) strategy would entail the initiation of a DDR together with the onset of the regeneration process to ensure rapid DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Studies that have repeatedly initiated the regeneration process, for example when newt lenses were removed and successfully regenerated 19 times over 18 years, support this hypothesis since the structure and function of the genome would remain intact over many rounds of cell division (Sousounis et al., 2015; Eguchi et al., 2011; Sousounis et al., 2014a). In addition, high-throughput gene expression datasets acquired from regenerative tissues show up-regulation of DNA repair genes across multiple organs and animal species, indicating that a proper DDR might be an innate part of the regenerative mechanism (Sousounis et al., 2014; Darnet et al., 2019; Barghouth et al., 2019; Shiroor et al., 2019; Bedelbaeva et al., 2010). This mechanism could occur in conjunction with clearing senescent cells from regenerating tissues, which would allow only resilient proliferating progenitors to be present in the blastema (Yun et al., 2015).",
