Reptiles, crustaceans, and insects amputate appendages in response to threats, while ants temporarily fuse for collective behaviors like bridge building. Morphological editing involves mass addition and subtraction, linking to modular robotics where synthetic body morphology is revised by rearranging parts. This work describes a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint has a modulus similar to materials used in soft robotics, allowing distribution throughout soft robot bodies without mechanical incongruities. Two embodiments demonstrate utility: a self-amputating soft quadruped robot and a cluster of three fusing soft-crawling robots.",

Self-amputation (autotomy) and dynamic aggregation (interfusion) are striking examples. Autotomy allows animals to amputate appendages to escape danger, like lizards shedding tails or crabs shedding injured appendages. Dynamic aggregation in insects, especially ants, enables collective behaviors like bridge formation or floating by rearranging mechanical connections.

A key feature enabling these adaptations is the ability to form and break connections within and between bodies.",
