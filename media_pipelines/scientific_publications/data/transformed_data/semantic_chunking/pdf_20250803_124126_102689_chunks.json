Cowan et al. discuss familial studies identifying mutations in Nodal and other genes, but these explain only a minority of sporadic heterotaxy cases. They used array-based genotyping to discover copy number variants (CNVs) in patients with heterotaxy, implicating genes with cilia-related functions and others like PFKP, which may have a non-glycolytic role in L/R patterning.",
