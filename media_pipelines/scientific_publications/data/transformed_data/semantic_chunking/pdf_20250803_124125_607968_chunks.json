Embryonic development can often adjust its morphogenetic processes to counteract external perturbation. The existence of self-monitoring responses during pattern formation is of considerable importance to the biomedicine of birth defects, but has not been quantitatively addressed. To understand the computational capabilities of biological tissues in a molecularly tractable model system, we induced craniofacial defects in *Xenopus* embryos, then tracked tadpoles with craniofacial deformities and used geometric morphometric techniques to characterize changes in the shape and position of the craniofacial structures.",

In physics, \\\"least action\\\" principles describe a system's behavior in terms of maximizing (or minimizing) some well-defined quantity, such as entropy, energy, or symmetry. The resulting statistical mechanics deals with systems (e.g., gasses) as ensembles of lower-level units, giving rise to a mature science of thermodynamics and near-ubiquitously applicable concepts like entropy (Goodwin, 1964; Brooks and Wiley, 1988; Weber et al., 1988). In computer science, a system's behavior is described in terms of the data that a given information-processing algorithm uses to make decisions. In this approach, neither matter nor energy but information exchanged among black-box components is used as the perspective from which quantitative predictions of physical (Frieden, 1998; Siegfried, 2000) and social (Langton, 1995; Couzin, 2009; Deisboeck and Couzin, 2009) systems are derived.",

Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of quantitative data from which testable models of this type can be inferred.

It has long been known that in many species, developmental programs are not \\\"hardcoded\\\" (occurring in the same way regardless of circumstances) but in fact are able to correct for a large number of significant external perturbations.

Another is the regeneration of a perfectly sized, placed, and oriented limb when a salamander's appendage is amputated in adulthood. A myriad of examples familiar to classical developmental and regenerative biologists show that patterning systems can detect damage (deviation from a predetermined target morphology), take steps to correct their pattern toward that goal state, and stop growth or rearrangements at the correct time. Indeed, this sometimes uses unnatural intermediate stages (Voskoboynik et al., 2007). For our understanding of these processes to aid in design of biomedical strategies, quantitative analysis of morphological responses to perturbations must nucleate predictive models of tissue behavior. We sought to establish a proof of principle approach using quantification of shape and shape changes during experimentally altered development in a genetically tractable model system, to derive hypotheses about what information tissues have and exchange, and what actions lead to normalization during complex pattern formation.",

In frog embryos, a population of CNC cells migrates collectively out from the border of the neural plate, before neural tube closure, to form these craniofacial structures (Sadaghiani and Thiebaud, 1987; Mayor and Aybar, 2001). The signals necessary for the induction, specification, migration, and differentiation of these cells into the structures of the head and face have been well characterized (Basch et al., 2004; Alfandari et al., 2010; Theveneau and Mayor, 2011). Other structures of the face including the eye lens, olfactory bulb, and otic vesicle develop from cranial placodes—specialized regions of the ectoderm (Brugmann and Moody, 2005; Streit, 2007). The placodes originally form as thickened areas of the ectoderm that invaginate to produce the sensory organs. While neural crest and placodes develop in similar ways from similar cell populations, the placodes have a more restricted developmental potential and are significantly less migratory (Schlosser, 2006).",

What deviations from the normal course of development can be sensed by this system, and what information do cells use in the repair process? One extremely powerful tool for analyzing craniofacial morphologies is geometric morphometrics of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images and structures (Singh, 2008). Geometric morphometric analysis involves the identification of landmarks on samples that mark discrete anatomical features; the alignment of landmarks using a mathematical algorithm that removes information about scale and rotation of specimens; and the use of multivariate statistics to study relationships among groups of samples (von Cramon-Taubadel et al., 2007). This analytical method has been applied to the study of craniofacial structures across human populations (Weisensee and Jantz, 2011), as a means to determine the effectiveness of treatments for craniofacial malformations (Singh et al., 2005), to diagnose craniofacial anomalies (Harris and Ross, 2008), to classify the effects of craniofacial toxicants (Klingenberg et al., 2010), to characterize long-range signaling in appendage regeneration (Mondia et al., 2011), and even to determine the age at which the human skull reaches fully formed adult features (Ross and Williams, 2010).

      "text": "Perturbed Tadpole Faces Correct Their Anatomy Over Time. The first step to establish a model for analysis of shape robustness, self-monitoring, and repair of a complex multi-tissue organ system, is to quantify shape and shape change in such a system. We induced perturbations of the face of the *Xenopus* tadpole by injecting mRNA into only one cell at the two cell stage of development, thus generating tadpoles that have abnormal structures induced on only one side. Injection of mRNA encoding a dominant mutant form of ductin, subunit C of the H-V-ATPase, produces tadpoles with perturbed development of the eyes, jaws, branchial arches, nose, and otolith/otocyst (Vandenberg et al., 2011), but no systematic description of the patterning consequences of such changes has yet been attempted. To that end, we imaged affected tadpoles at several discrete periods after fertilization. Strikingly, as these tadpoles aged, the craniofacial perturbations (whether on the left, right, or both sides of the face) became less apparent over time, and relatively normal faces were constructed despite the deviations in initial states (Fig. 1).",

The effects on the eyes were most pronounced, with abnormal shapes rarely changing, even over months (Fig. 2A). Affected nostrils, including those originally formed connected to the eye, did achieve a more normalized placement, but their morphology remained somewhat abnormal with strands of ectopic tissue between the nose and eye (Fig. 2A). Tadpoles that were missing otoliths in their otocyst cavities never produced these absent structures (Fig. 2B), and ectopic structures were never resorbed into the tadpole (Fig. 2B).
