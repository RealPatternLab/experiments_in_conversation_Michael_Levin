Here we show that myeloid differentiation is crucial to modulate the regenerative ability of Xenopus tadpoles in a HDAC activity-dependent fashion. HDAC activity inhibition during the first wave of myeloid differentiation disrupted myeloid cells dynamics in the regenerative bud as well the mRNA expression pattern of myeloid markers, such as LURP, MPOX, Spib and mmp7. We also functionally bridge the spatial and temporal dynamics of lipid droplets, the main platform of lipid mediators synthesis in myeloid cells during the inflammatory response, and the regenerative ability of Xenopus tadpoles. In addition, we showed that 15-LOX activity is necessary during tail regeneration. Taken together our results support a role for the epigenetic control of myeloid behavior during tissue and organ regeneration, which may positively impact translational approaches for regenerative medicine.",

      "text": "Tissue and organ regeneration is a fascinating topic of study that has caught the attention of several generations of scientists. Different models of study have been used to unravel the cellular, genetic and molecular basis of animal regeneration. One of the most widely used model is the tail of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. In fact, between larval stages 40 and 44, swimming tadpoles have an amazing ability to regenerate tissues and organs upon tail amputation. About 72 h post amputation, tadpoles regenerate notochord, muscles, epidermis and nervous system. Studying this regenerative capacity is extremely attractive as it resembles mammalian regeneration much more than the regenerative strategies in anurans, such as salamander, for example. For these reasons, this is a very tractable model to deep explore the main mechanisms involved in tissue and organ regeneration with critical implications for translational medicine.",

In fact, it has been shown that key molecular pathways such as TGF-β, BMP, Wnt (Beck et al., 2003; Ho and Whitman, 2008; Sugiura et al., 2009), along with bioelectrical signaling (Adams et al., 2007; Beane et al., 2013; Levin, 2007, 2014; A. S. Tseng, Beane, Lemire, Masi and Levin, 2010) are tight regulated upon Xenopus tail amputation, both in time and space, giving rise to a finely tuned program that drives full organ regeneration. During regeneration, TGF-ẞ is important not just for setting but also maintaining the regenerative competence, acting in wound epithelium formation, establishment of regeneration bud structures, signaling cascades and regulation of cell proliferation (Ho and Whitman, 2008). BMP induces muscle tail formation and triggers Notch, which in turn, will give rise to the outgrowth of the notochord and the neural tube (Slack et al., 2004). BMP also drives Wnt, which is also required for Xenopus tail regeneration, specially at the first 48hpa (Lin and Slack, 2008; Slack et al., 2004).",

For instance, cells from myeloid origin such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils have been implicated in zebrafish, axolot and mouse regeneration (Aurora et al., 2014; Godwin et al., 2013; Morales and Allende, 2019; Petrie et al., 2014). Regardless Aztekin et al. (2020) have recently demonstrated that myeloid cells play a crucial role during Xenopus tail regeneration, evidences for the molecular basis of myeloid behavior control during tail regeneration are still lacking. As in mammals, Xenopus myeloid cells are first generated during embryonic stages during the so called first wave of differentiation, or primitive hematopoiesis, in a specialized tissue that is homolog to the mammalian yolk sac, the anterior ventral blood island (aVBI) at the neurula stage (Ciau-Uitz et al., 2010; Ciau-Uitz et al., 2000; Lane and Sheets, 2002; Lane and Smith, 1999). In addition to the primitive hematopoiesis, Xenopus also present a second wave of hematopoietic differentiation, the definitive hematopoiesis, that takes place in the dorso-lateral plate mesoderm (DLP) starting from stage 43 (Ciau-Uitz et al., 2000; Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996).",

Upon specification, Spib + cells start migrating away aiming to colonize the developing embryo. Spib is the spi 1/pu.1 zebrafish homolog and is necessary for hemangioblast-like cells differentiation into primitive myeloid precursor cells that will disperse into the embryo even before the raising of functional vessels (Costa et al., 2008). In fact, other myeloid markers such as mmp7, LURP and MPOX are downstream targets of Spib and contribute to different biological functions of myeloid cells, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, phagocytosis and immune defense (Harrison et al., 2004; Paredes et al., 2015; S. J. Smith, Kotecha, Towers, Latinkic and Mohun, 2002). More specifically, LURP and MPOx are co-expressed in myeloid precursors, promoting their migration through the embryo (S. J. Smith et al., 2002). Costa et al. have shown that spib positive cells are capable of migration towards an injury site during tailbud-stage, displaying in this way a functional behavior even in the absence of a functional vasculature. In this sense, macrophages and neutrophils are the two main myeloid population with relevant roles during regeneration.",

In this work we showed that the treatment of regenerating swimming tadpoles, starting at stage 40, with HDAC inhibitors (iHDACs) impairs regeneration and leads to a lack of regenerative ability. In addition, we have recently shown that iHDAC treatment of mammalian myeloid cells both in vitro and in vivo disrupts myeloid differentiation favoring cell cycling in detriment of cell differentiation (Cabanel et al., 2015; Cabanel, da Costa, El-Cheikh and Carneiro, 2019). As a consequence, myeloid progenitors display a high plastic phenotype favoring an anti-inflammatory functional profile. These findings are very interesting because, given the anti-inflammatory activity of HDAC inhibitors (iHDAC), we hypothesized that HDAC activity blockade might be dampening the inflammatory response from the onset, which in turn, would be required for regeneration. Thus, in the present paper, we hypothesized whether epigenetic mechanisms HDAC-dependent would emerge as putative candidates playing key roles as myeloid cells modulators for new strategies to improve regeneration in vertebrates. Therefore, iHDAC should be dampening the inflammatory response evoked by myeloid cells, which is also supposed to be necessary for Xenopus tail regeneration.",

      "text": "It has been shown that both VBI and DLP contribute with embryonic and definitive/adult blood cells, respectively. The VBI has been separated into two different territories: aVBI and pVBI, which give rise to erythrocytes and myeloid cells. pVBI also gives rise to short term lymphoid cells (T cells) (Costa et al., 2008; Rollins-Smith and Blair, 1990; P. B. Smith and Turpen, 1985; Tashiro et al., 2006). DLP, in turn, gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells and therefore to all hematopoietic lineages in the adult (Chen and Turpen, 1995; Kau and Turpen, 1983). These two waves of hematopoietic differentiation take place at different times and at different sites into the embryo. While the first wave takes place at ventral sites of the embryo starting at stage 19, the second one starts only at stage 43 at dorsal sites. To better understand the epigenetic modulation of myeloid cells behavior during tail regeneration, we first investigated the requirement of HDAC activity during the first and/or the second waves of myeloid differentiation as well as its contribution to the regenerative ability. For this, tadpoles from different developmental stages, covering both the first or the second wave of myeloid differentiation, were incubated with iHDAC (Fig. 1A). Interestingly incubation with iHDAC exclusively during the first 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hpa, starting at stage 40, was sufficient to gradually impair the regenerative ability observed in control group (Fig. 1B,B'). In contrast, when tadpoles were incubated exclusively after the first 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hpa, until stage 47/48, the regenerative ability was gradually rescued (Fig. 1C,C'). We conclude that the first 24 hpa, which exclusively encompasses the first wave of myeloid differentiation, are crucial to epigenetically modulate the regenerative ability of Xenopus tadpoles.",

We conclude that HDAC activity is necessary for the proper establishment of cellular dynamics in the regenerative bud at 24 hpa. In addition, we identified that cells displaying phagocytic activity with cytochemistry markers of monocytes/macrophages are components of the cellular population observed in the regenerative bud of Xenopus tadpoles.",

      "text": "Next, we sought to demonstrate the myeloid origin of the cells above reported. Spib is one of the earliest genes to be expressed in the myeloid differentiation cascade at stage 17 while Xpox2, the ortholog of zebrafish mpox coding for myeloperoxidase and commonly expressed by neutrophils since embryogenesis in mammalians, is first detected in the anterior-ventral mesoderm at stage 19 and, at the tail-bud stage, can be found throughout the whole embryo (S. J. Smith et al., 2002). In fact, it has been shown, starting from stage 19, the existence of cellular sub-set whose phenotype is Spib+/Xpox2+, mostly representing granulocytes. In addition, mmp7 (matrilysin), a mettaloproteinase whose activity is linked to extra cellular matrix remodeling, has been described to be expressed at stage 18 in a punctate pattern in the aVBI (Harrison et al., 2004). MMP7+ cells represent phagocytic cells derived from Spib+ precursors such as macrophages (Costa et al., 2008) that lie in between the epidermis and mesoderm compatible with a pattern displayed by resident macrophages at stages 37/38 (Harrison et al., 2004). In fact, Spib morpholino injected embryos lack the expression of both downstream targets Xpox2 and mmp7 resulting in a lack of primitive myeloid cells (Costa et al., 2008). We then hypothesized whether myeloid cells are necessary for Xenopus tail regeneration and whether HDAC activity is necessary to their behavior. To start addressing this question, we injected embryos with Spib anti-sense morpholinos at the 4 cells stage and, at the stage 40, the tadpoles were amputated, and the regeneration was scored at 72 h post amputation. To access Spib knockdown we first performed an in situ hybridization for mmp7 mRNA at the neurula stage (stage 20). In fact, Spib morpholino injected embryos presented a substantial reduction in the mmp7 expression domain (Fig. 3). Using two different concentrations of Spib morpholinos we consistently observed that Spib morpholino injected embryos present an impairment in tail regeneration when compared to scramble injected embryos. Spib knockdown led to 30% of non-regenerating tadpoles in the absence of considerable toxicity (Fig. 3).",

      "text": "Besides Spib, Xpox2 and mmp7, Smith et al. described a myeloid-specific gene promoter that provided a molecular marker for myeloid cells at the early tail-bud stage. In this work Smith et al. proposed that Ly-6/uPAR-related protein (XLURP-1) positive cells would be divided in two different sub-sets of myeloid cells: XLURP-1+/Xpox2+ and XLURP-1/Xpox2+ suggesting the existence of at least two different cellular sub-sets of myeloid cells starting at the late tail-bud stage. On the other hand, despite displaying a similar punctate pattern of Xpox2, XLURP-1 transcripts were detected only starting from stage 24 onward. At stage 41 XLURP-1 positive cells present irregular shape suggesting that they may be resident phagocytic cells such as macrophages (S. J. Smith et al., 2002). In addition, XLURP-1 positive cells were found in the peripheral blood vessels suggesting a patrolling behavior. Because Xpox2 and XLURP-1 also identifies myeloid populations in the developing embryo, we hypothesized whether XLURP-1 positive cells would be recruited into the regenerative bud, in a HDAC-activity dependent fashion, forming an infiltrate-like. LURP-GFP transgenic tadpoles were raised until stage 40 when were amputated and immediately placed in a solution containing iHDAC or DMSO for 24, 48 or 72hrs and at every time point, the number of GFP+ cells was counted/area of the regenerating tissue. We observed at 24 hpa a consistent increase in the number of GFP+ cells/area in iHDAC treated tadpoles (Fig. 4). In addition, we also quantified the endogenous levels of LURP mRNA by real time PCR at 24 and 72 hpa. Regardless we did not observe any change in transcripts levels at 24 hpa between control and iHDAC tadpoles, we detected an increase in LURP mRNA levels at 72 hpa in the iHDAC group (Supplementary Fig. 5). We conclude that LURP+ cells are necessary for tail regeneration and that their behavior is modulated by HDAC activity.",

      "text": "Love et al. have successfully accessed the initial inflammatory response following Xenopus tail amputation. In fact they described through in situ hybridization and sudan black staining, that mmp7 mRNA is up regulated as well as neutrophils, respectively, as early as 6 h post amputation, remaining for several days (Love et al., 2011). Here we asked whether HDAC activity would modulate the relative expression of mmp7, MPOX and spib during tail regeneration. To answer this question, we performed real time PCR to quantify the expression levels of this set of transcripts. In fact, at 24 hpa we observed a decrease in mmp7 mRNA expression levels, that was maintained at 72 hpa (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we observed that spib and MPOX mRNA expression levels were increased when compared to control groups. These results argue in favor of an epigenetic control of the inflammatory response during tail regeneration. Given that MPOX is a myeloid marker for neutrophils, we interpret that HDAC activity blockade led to the persistence of the inflammatory response at 72 hpa, which is inversely proportional to the regenerative ability. In addition, increased levels of spib mRNA indicates that more undifferentiated myeloid cells are present in the regenerative bud if HDAC activity is suppressed. However, at this developmental stage, we are not able to separate myeloid cells form the first and the second wave of hematopoiesis. This hypothesis is in agreement with low levels of mmp7 mRNA expression levels which also argue in favor of a low phagocytic activity of myeloid cells and as a consequence, low inflammatory response. We conclude that HDAC activity is necessary for the establishment of transcriptional patterns compatible with the inflammatory response during tail regeneration.",

      "text": "During tissue regeneration, acute inflammation has been shown as key player to trigger the main mechanisms that will drive regeneration. In fact, different works in zebra fish (Kyritsis et al., 2012; Morales and Allende, 2019; Petrie et al., 2014), salamander (Godwin et al., 2013) and mouse (Aurora et al., 2014) have addressed this question. Similarly, the key role for inflammation during Xenopus laevis tail regeneration has also been successfully addressed (Aztekin et al., 2020; Fukazawa et al., 2009; Love et al., 2013). To address whether the HDAC activity is necessary for the inflammatory response during Xenopus tail regeneration, we decided first to investigate the temporal dynamics of lipid droplets (LD) upon tail amputation. LD are osmiophilic subcellular components of leucocytes such as monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils that are involved during the inflammatory response. Upon the inflammatory stimulus, LD may increase either in size and in number and serves as a reservoir of lipid mediators and their enzymes, including 15-lipoxigenase (15-LOX) (Melo et al., 2011). As we have showed that HDAC activity blockade led to a disruption in the populational dynamics of leucocytes during tail regeneration, we decided to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of LD upon tail amputation and under the blockade of HDAC activity. For this, LD were visualized by conventional Oil Red staining and Osmiun tetroxide impregnation followed by light microscopy. We have shown that naphthyl esterase + cells (monocytes/macrophages) are among the cellular components during tail regeneration. In addition, real time PCR also showed evidences for the presence of neutrophils (MPOX). These two cellular types are tight correlated to the inflammatory response and may represent the main source of LD in the context of tail regeneration. In fact, we were able to characterize the pattern of Oil Red + vesicles distribution along the time in control and iHDAC tadpoles when compared to untreated, normal tails. It was possible to note that the number of Oil Red + vesicles/area of tissue decreased along the time during normal tail development (Fig. 6K, red line). When control and iHDAC groups were analyzed at 24 and 72 hpa, we observed that the overall dynamics was not disrupted, but the number of Oil Red + vesicles/area of tissue was lower than the number observed for normal tails (Fig. 6A and B,D,F,G,I). However we did not detected significant differences between control and iHDAC tadpoles at 24 and 72 hpa (Fig. 6K). Using osmium impregnation we were able to detect multilocular cells at 24 hpa in semithin sections for electron microscopy preparations that were no longer observed at 72 hpa in control tadpoles (Fig. 6C,C',E). In iHDAC treated tadpoles we did not observe multilocular cells but instead, we observed osmiophilic vesicles at 72 hpa that were not observed in control groups (Fig. 6 J,J').",

For this, amputated tails were placed in baicalein soon after amputation and aged until stage 47/48, when tadpoles were scored. In fact, 15-LOX blockade during tail regeneration led to tail regeneration impairment (Fig. 6).

      "text": "In the present paper we aimed to characterize the epigenetic control HDAC- dependent of tissue and organ regenerative capacity using Xenopus tail as experimental model. Regardless it is already well established in the literature that the acute inflammatory response, through an injury, exerts a protective effect on the organism (Kyritsis et al., 2012; Mescher et al., 2017), tractable strategies to modulate inflammation favoring tissue and organ regeneration are still lacking. Similarly to mammals, the hematopoiesis in amphibians generates myeloid cells with critical physiological roles both during embryonic and adult life. In both animals the first wave of differentiation gives rise to myeloid cells that will spread in the embryo and play crucial roles during morphogenesis and regeneration (Agricola et al., 2016; Costa et al., 2008). We showed that in the absence of HDAC activity the number of LURP-GFP+ cells in the regenerative bud was increased without a consistent increase in the levels of endogenous mRNA levels of LURP. Interpreting this result, we found a stinking similar pattern observed in mice upon iHDAC treatment of myeloid precursors at 24 hpa (Cabanel et al., 2015, 2019). While control group displayed a lower number of LURP-GFP + cells, these cells might express high levels of this protein being classified as LURP-GFphigh sub-set (pro-inflammatory monocytes). In contrast, because iHDAC treated tadpoles presented increased number of LURP-GFP + cells, they may belong to a different sub-set of cells, which in turn will display low levels of LURP-GFP + being classified as LURP-GFPlow (patrolling/anti-inflammatory/pro-resolutive monocytes). This may explain why despite a higher number of total LURP-GFP + cells, iHDAC treated tadpoles did not present a consistent increase in LURP mRNA levels at this time point. This scenario is also compatible with low levels of mmp7 mRNA expression, which indicates low inflammatory activity. Taken together these results indicates that iHDAC treatment impaired the inflammatory response at 24 hpa compromising, in this way, the outcome of the main regenerative events that will follow.",
