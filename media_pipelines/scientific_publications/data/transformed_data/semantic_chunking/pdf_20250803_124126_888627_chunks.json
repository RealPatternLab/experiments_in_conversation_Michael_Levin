Two \"caged\" 5-HT forms, BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT, were created. BHQ-O-5HT releases 5-HT upon exposure to 365 or 740 nm light through one- or two-photon excitation, respectively. BHQ-O-5HT mediated changes in neural activity in cultured mouse primary sensory neurons and the trigeminal ganglion and optic tectum of intact zebrafish larvae.
