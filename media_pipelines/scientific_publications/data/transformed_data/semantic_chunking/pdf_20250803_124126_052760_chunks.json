      "text": "Injury progression associated with cerebral laceration is insidious. Following the initial trauma, brain tissues become hyperexcitable, leading to further damage. Clinicians employ strategies to mitigate secondary brain injury; however, better screening tools are needed to expedite mechanistic studies and drug discovery for enhanced neural tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. This study presents a bioengineered cortical brain model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) exhibiting primary and secondary injury characteristics, including radiating cell death and increased glutamate release with excitotoxic features. DNA content and tissue function were normalized by high-concentration, chronic gabapentinoid administrations. Further experiments suggest the treatment effects were neuroprotective rather than regenerative, evidenced by drug-mediated decreases in cell excitability and no drug-induced proliferation. The TBI model demonstrates validity and can serve as a customizable platform to assess cell type contributions to TBI progression and screen anti-excitotoxic and pro-regenerative compounds.",
