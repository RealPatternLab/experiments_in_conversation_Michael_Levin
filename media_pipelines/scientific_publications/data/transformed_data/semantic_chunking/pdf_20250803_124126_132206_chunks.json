This paper explores how foreign agents (pathogens, parasites, trophoblasts) and self-defecting agents (cancer cells) manipulate these networks, exploiting host plasticity to reshape morphology, function, and behavior. Intruders breach barriers, mimic host signals, alter immune defenses, and disrupt homeostatic setpoints, redirecting metabolic flows and overriding neural, immune, and endocrine signaling. These conserved manipulation strategies transform stable structures into flexible substrates, remodeling host tissues and creating niches for survival. Understanding these exploitation routes clarifies self-organization and identity maintenance principles, informing therapeutic strategies for restoring normal tissue states and opening new avenues for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.",

The hacker metaphor applies as agents subvert default control paths at all levels, from molecular \"hardware\" to cellular \"social engineering.\"  We examine scenarios where an intruder invades and alters a host's environment for its advantage, excluding mutualistic symbioses.

The first step involves breaking persistent pathological states by creating defined windows of plasticity, mirroring natural developmental transitions. Moderate acute inflammation can prompt setpoint re-evaluation without extensive damage.  Once destabilized, tissues must be steered towards desirable endpoints during the brief window of plasticity. Reprogramming requires carefully timed signals guiding cells into the desired identity, potentially achieved through sensing modules, inducible circuits, or timed-release vehicles.
