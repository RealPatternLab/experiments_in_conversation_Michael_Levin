      "text": "Learning and a spectrum of other behavioral competencies allow organisms to rapidly adapt to dynamically changing environmental variations. The emerging field of diverse intelligence seeks to understand what systems, besides ones with complex brains, exhibit these capacities. Here, we tested predictions of a general computational framework based on the free energy principle in neuroscience but applied to aneural biological process as established previously, by demonstrating and manipulating pattern recognition in a simple aneural organism, the green algae Volvox. Our studies of the adaptive photoresponse in Volvox reveal that aneural organisms can distinguish between patterned and randomized inputs and indicate how this is achieved mechanistically. We show that the phototactic response in Volvox adapts more readily to regular light pulse patterns than to irregular ones, thus exhibiting a crucial component of basal intelligence - generalization: the ability to recognize patterns in input stimuli. Randomized electric shocks reduced the ability of Volvox to maintain adaptive phototaxis significantly more than regularly applied electric shocks, providing first evidence for a stress effect of randomized input patterns in a primitive organism. Moreover, we detected memory in Volvox – a persistence of movement towards past light stimulation through their phototactic orientation, another foundational aspect of neural-like primitive cognition. Combined, these data reveal that Volvox exhibit a capacity for pattern recognition consistent with uncertainty minimization. The ability of algae to be surprised and distinguish random events that do not meet expected patterns further expands neurobiological concepts beyond neurons. These methods can likely be translated to the study and manipulation of basal cognition in many other living systems.",

Interestingly, this does not require brains or advanced nervous systems. Examples of learning and adaptive behavioral responses in aneural organisms include context-dependent motility, stress response-triggered learning, anticipation, long range spatial decision-making, and associative learning in a range of microbial organisms. Even Embryophytes, despite their apparent lack of dynamic motility, possess highly complex adaptive responses through their fast and complex internal calcium signaling patterns. Similarly, in vascular plants, synaptic adhesions domains and action potentials, yield self-identity and recognition capabilities through their use of plant-specific synapses in Cayratia japonica, and can detect acoustic vibrations from feeding caterpillars and subsequent elicitation of chemical defenses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore the slime mold Physarum detects materials properties of its environment via pulsatile mechanosensing and makes growth decisions based on information gleaned about objects at long range.",

      "text": "The ability to detect environmental patterns and distinguish them from random noise is considered a basic component of intelligence – the inference of a general pattern from particular experiences. Such a pattern can serve as the primitive basis of counterfactuals, because the recognition of a pattern endows an organism with expectations for what should happen next, before it happens. While ubiquitous seasonal and day-night cycles provide a highly reliable environmental pattern which is constant across generations (and thus can serve as a stable target for selection), it is unclear how much individual aneural organisms can detect and adapt to novel and more variable patterns on much shorter timescales. Our work was motivated by two inter-related questions: How far down the evolutionary scale of complexity do organisms exhibit the ability to detect novel environmental patterns, and do they have expectations that may or may not be met? What frameworks can help us understand these capacities in novel substrates?",

An example of environmentally triggered immediate changes in current cellular active states is seen in basic phototactic organisms, where light-induced protein conformation states coupled to changes in flagellar beating rates result in movement towards or away from light stimuli. The short-term changes in light sensitivity and downstream flagellar beating responsivity that are the core of this ability to orient towards light and maintain direction are referred to as photoadaptation. While the mechanisms of delayed adaptive responses of light-sensitive cells are fairly well-understood in the human visual system as being mediated through intracellular signaling coupled to transcription, translation, and epigenetic modifications, photoadaptation has not been well studied in simpler phototactic organisms such as Volvox.",

      "text": "Work over the last decade has shown that patterned environmental stimuli that differ only in the frequency of presentation to the organism, can elicit distinct downstream signaling events and functional (behavioral) outcomes in many kinds of cellular systems. For example, Mitchell et al. varied osmotic concentrations over time in pulsatile fashion and identified a frequency-specific activation and refractory relationship in the MAPK pathway that inhibits yeast growth severely, but only at specific frequencies of osmotic oscillation. The use of optogenetics to dynamically activate signaling pathways has been a significant contributor to further understanding the mechanistic basis for this ability. A prominent example comes from the Toettcher group, which used optogenetic activation of EGF to vary the temporal dynamics of ERK signaling and showed that temporal variation in activation pulse frequency induction of ERK signaling not only affects the amount of transcription and subsequent translation of a target gene, but can also trigger transcription of different target genes.",

Thus, here we aimed to understand these phenomena from a top-down perspective focusing on the response of the system to patterns and information content in its environment - by generalizing a theoretical framework of adaptive responses to dynamic inputs reminiscent of higher-level information processing common to many cellular systems. Using a cognitive Bayesian framework based on our earlier work and that of Karl Friston and others in the field, we can formulate a model of cellular beliefs (or predictions) that encode what type of signals the cell expects to receive at any given point in time. These cellular beliefs encompass all the receptors and cellular machinery currently expressed and represent the cell's best estimate of which physiological and transcriptional state will make it the most adaptable to current and anticipated environmental effects. Regulatory output aimed at modifying the signaling activity could hence be interpreted as the effort to minimize uncertainties in measurements of the environment compared to expected signaling inputs.",

The ensuing transcriptional outputs and functional changes of proteins realize a constant modification of physiological and biophysical parameters affecting signaling transmission.

These ideas are frequently discussed with respect to neural brain mechanisms; however, given the wide conservation of signaling mechanisms and algorithms across neural and non-neural cells, it becomes especially interesting to ask whether systems with no brains, and no neurons, can likewise support expectations about the future born of pattern inference, and exhibit responses which reveal that these expectations cannot be met in random environments. Here, we test the hypothesis that aneural organisms can display actionable pattern recognition in general and uncertainty minimization in particular. We chose to investigate this using the photoadaptive response in two different subspecies of the chlorophyte green algae Volvox (Volvox carteri and Volvox aureus) as a readily measurable adaptive behavior to an external physical stimulus that can be varied in any temporal pattern.",

We designed an experimental platform that allows us to compare Volvox phototaxis towards two distinct regimes of light stimuli with different patterns of light pulsation, exploring mechanisms and long-term effects on the organism. We complement the phototactic trajectories obtained from these experiments with gain-of-function drug experiments focused on shifting phototactic biases based on both our knowledge of underlying molecular pathways and their effect on their information processing modalities. We furthermore also tested whether Volvox exhibit short-term memory towards past light stimuli in terms of their phototactic paths, which would provide them with further crucial neural-like capabilities. We also tested whether Volvox' photosynthesis would also be affected by dynamic light patterns in an attempt to detect metabolic manifestations of uncertainty minimization in Volvox. Finally, to begin exploring the potential for training of Volvox photoaxis to desired light pattern biases, we examined whether patterned electric shocks could manipulate Volvox responses to patterned light stimuli.

Then, light intensity was measured using a photometer probe at 2 distances, right at the LED and at 6cm away from it, after which angle of the LED and resistance of the potentiometer were adjusted to achieve a good match of intensities from row to row, as well as from side to side. Quantification in this setup was achieved through collection of Volvox colonies in the different sections with subsequent manual counting using still images of the collected colony ensembles. Plots of phototactic biases using the setup shown in Figure 1 only consider the approximate position of Volvox in the end sections of the chambers which show a more pronounced bias due to the length of the chamber when compared to the second setup shown in Figure 2 which allows for less swimming back and forth of Volvox.",

Based on our central hypothesis of surprise minimization in aneural organisms, we tested the prediction that a phototactic organism such as Volvox would reveal a preference for order (or a dislike of unpredictability) by preferentially moving towards light stimulation patterns of higher regularity (and hence predictability). When we exposed Volvox to an overall equal amount of light over time but at a regular, fixed light pulse interval versus a randomized, irregular light pattern (see Figure 3), a significantly larger proportion of Volvox aureus were detected in the section adjacent to the fixed interval stimulation than in the section adjacent to the random stimulation (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), in accordance with our predictions based on uncertainty minimization. Because of this observed preferential movement of Volvox aureus to the regular 1 Hz light pattern when opposed with a randomized light pulse pattern of similar average pulse length, we conclude that Volvox can distinguish patterned light stimuli from random ones, a fundamental building block for intelligent information processing.",

We used this apparatus to test the same hypothesis on another species of Volvox, V. carteri, which is evolutionarily distant from V. aureus by an estimated 75 million years. Our results in this automated platform show that, as for V. aureus, V. carteri also exhibits a photoadaptive bias towards a regular light pulse pattern vs. a random one (see Figure 3a), as over time, more Volvox swam closer to the patterned stimulus side than to the randomized stimulus side (p<0.01). We exploited the detailed quantitative nature of this imaging apparatus to investigate the influence of Volvox colony size (µm), swimming speed and the number of colonies inside the chamber on its phototactic bias using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis. The PCA revealed that the first two principal components accounted for 91.07% of the total variance in the data, with PC1 explaining 56.72% and PC2 explaining 34.35%.

      "text": "The strong positive loading for both Volvox colony size and swimming speed in PC1 suggest a robust positive correlation between these two variables, indicating that larger Volvox colonies tend to swim at higher speeds in our system. This relationship could be attributed to the increased propulsive force generated by larger colonies with more flagellated cells. The strong negative loading for the number of colonies per frame in PC2 suggests that this component appears to represent colony density, largely independent of size and speed. The moderate negative loading for speed on this component suggests a slight tendency for lower swimming speeds in frames with higher colony counts, possibly due to increased hydrodynamic or direct flagellar interactions, leading to Volvox colonies getting stuck to each other temporarily. PC3, while only explaining 8.94% of the variance, revealed an interesting contrast between colony size and swimming speed. This minor component might capture exceptions to the main trend, possibly representing scenarios where larger colonies move more slowly or smaller colonies move more quickly and could be related to variations in colony morphology, flagellar activity, or local environmental conditions. The high cumulative variance explained by PC1 and PC2 (91.07%) indicates that the three-dimensional data can be effectively represented in two dimensions with minimal loss of information. This suggests a strong underlying structure in the Volvox population dynamics, primarily driven by the size-speed relationship and variations in colony density. Based on this analysis, we filtered Volvox by size (colony diameter between 120 and 150µm) and swimming speeds (larger than 120 µm/s) for higher uniformity and standardization of our data. Thus, the most effective distinction between the random and patterned stimuli was being carried out by Volvox of that size and swimming speed.",

      "text": "We next examined which light pulse frequencies, if any, Volvox most readily adapt to – by exposing Volvox inside the channel to different light pulse frequencies on each side of the chamber. We tested various pulse frequencies from 50Hz to 1Hz and determined the percent of Volvox that swam to each end of the chamber (see Figure 4). There was a clear preferential adaptive response to light pulse frequencies of 2 Hz when opposed to smaller and larger pulse frequencies respectively (p<0.001 as determined by Wilcoxon signed-rank test). From this we conclude that Volvox distinguish different regular patterns in terms of their adaptive, phototactic response. Using the automated tracking apparatus, we also tested the presence of a phototactic biases in Volvox carteri for the highly significant case of 1 Hz vs. 2 Hz in Volvox aureus. However, unlike in V. aureus (see Figure 4), in V. carteri there was no difference between photoadaptive responses to either opposing light stimuli of 1 and 2 Hz respectively. We only compared two frequencies, so it is very possible that photoadaptation in V. carteri is optimized to a different frequency range than in V. aureus, possibly due to a slightly different flagellar response times or an overall rotational speed difference compared to V. aureus. These differences would need to be investigated in future studies, as no such detailed studies have been done in Volvox aureus. The data from section 3.1 on the patterned vs. randomized light sequences, combined with these data on different light pulse frequencies in two similarly simple aneural species, support the hypothesis that even aneural organisms can detect patterns and tend to avoid random stimulation patterns precisely because of the difference in overall predictability of those stimulation patterns, and not just due to differences in frequency.",

      "text": "In order to probe how uncertainty minimization is implemented mechanistically on a physiological level, we built on work by Drescher et al. to simulate the adaptive phototactic response of V. carteri to the same types of input used in our experimental system above (Figures 1,2). We simulated flagellum beating speed downregulation in response to inputs reflecting fixed vs. randomized light pulse stimulations with similar average interval length and equal total light exposure. The average adaptive or recovery time (the time it takes for a flagellum to return to baseline beating frequency after photostimulation) obtained for the irregular, randomized light input series was greatly reduced (see Figure 5e). This was evidenced by the reduced time it took for simulated fluid speed induced by flagellar beating to return towards baseline following the random pulse sequence compared to the fixed pulse sequence (Figure 5c). Given the ubiquity of Poisson distributed neuronal activation patterns in neural organisms, we confirmed that when we randomized inputs by shuffling stimulation pulses (which constrained each stimulation to yield similar average pulse duration and equal total light exposure), the histogram of inter-pulse durations exhibited a Poisson distribution (see Figure 5f), which is the distribution most used to model natural pulsed stimulation patterns in human brains to avoid adaptation through habituation to repeated stimuli. As seen below, this opens up research on short term adaptation in Volvox as a foundation for learning, as Poisson type stimulation patterns have been shown to evoke distinct spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in neurons. In other words, neural systems react very differently to purely random Poisson distributed spike trains versus tightly regulated, repeatable activation patterns, the balance thereof being an active source for debate and likely varies in different neuronal systems depending on how tightly information is compressed at each level.",

First, we characterized how components integral to the modularity of the adaptive photoresponse (i.e., light activation and recovery time of downregulated flagellar beating speed) are implemented in Volvox. While initial calcium entry upon light activation occurs on the order of 19 milliseconds in this organism, its diffusion across the flagella has been estimated to take 0.2 seconds, a duration we can observe experimentally. We used nimodipine, a reagent commonly used to selectively inhibit calcium signaling, and was previously shown in the close Volvox relative Chlamydomonas to bind to a calcium inhibitor binding protein localized primarily in the cell-internal membrane. This enabled us to observe the adaptive response of Volvox to light inputs in real time during inhibition of signaling from the photoreceptor to the flagella (Figure 6). As blocking calcium this way slows down the calcium mediated signal progression from photoreceptor towards flagella and thereby causing a decrease in phototactic sensitivity, we can describe this effect in Volvox as an increase in the photoresponse time τ, introduced earlier. Note that we shifted the speed filtering criteria for both normal and nimodipine containing media for lower speeds, as nimodipine also reduced overall speeds as a consequence of lowered phototactic sensitivity.",

We found that in the presence of nimodipine, Volvox showed a significant phototactic bias towards the 2 Hz stimulus compared to the 1 Hz, while preference for the 1Hz regular stimulus compared to the random pulse sequence reversed. To explain this phenomenon, we turned back to the simulations from section 3.3, and simulated the fluid speed induced by flagellar beating in response to the same 2Hz frequency as before, but this time, to simulate the effect of nimodipine, we increased response time τř by an arbitrary factor of 5 (exact value would need experimental validation through high speed imaging of flagellar activity and fluid flow in response to the drug). We found that while the overall exponential fit was not too different from Figure 5e, the deceased response time reduces the overall amplitude of variation over the mean fluid response, making it more similar in shape to the regular step function. Using an analogy to human vision, this corresponds to shifting the high frequency light input below a flicker fusion rate (the rate at which an intermittent light stimulus is perceived as constant) the Volvox can perceive. While the response time was still reduced overall, the reduction in variations may mean there are fewer downstream influences that interfere with normal Volvox phototaxis. This suggests that inhibition of calcium release and diffusion shifts the sensed base frequency of the interval lengths that Volvox can perceive, akin to a flicker fusion rate in human vision, denoting a maximal light flickering frequency the human vision can no longer perceive as individual pulses.",

      "text": "A necessary condition for pattern recognition and tracking over time is the persistence of a stimulus' effect on its internal state over a limited amount of time – a type of memory. To prove the existence of such a persistence of effect in Volvox, we designed an experiment to test if phototactic alignment of Volvox towards one stimulus persists after that stimulus ends. We used the experimental platform described in Figure 1b and confined Volvox aureus into a 1 cm space at the center of the channel using transparent dividers and then illuminated them from one side with blue LED light for 5 minutes, after which we turned the light source off and allowed the Volvox colonies to travel freely for 10 minutes, collecting the Volvox at each section in the well as before. There was a significant (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) bias towards the previously illuminated side of the well, indicating persistence of phototactic alignment (Figure 7). A likely mechanism of this persistence of effect is a sufficient combination of initial orientation of the Volvox colony towards light stimulus and a maintenance of that orientation over short time scales even in the presence of small-scale perturbations. It is already known that the first part of that combination occurs: Volvox orient themselves towards light by virtue of the asymmetric distribution of photoreceptor activity along their sphere and flagellar orientation. The fact that in our experiment, Volvox were still preferentially distributed towards the light stimulus ten minutes after it ends is evidence for the swimming orientation in Volvox being stabilized when a light stimulus is removed, which is why our result is a first evidence of short term memory in Volvox.",
