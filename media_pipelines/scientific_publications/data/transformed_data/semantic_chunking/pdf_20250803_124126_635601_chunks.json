      "text": "Biophysical forces play important roles throughout embryogenesis, but the roles of spatial differences in cellular resting potentials during large-scale brain morphogenesis remain unknown. Here, we implicate endogenous bioelectricity as an instructive factor during brain patterning in *Xenopus laevis*. Early frog embryos exhibit a characteristic hyperpolarization of cells lining the neural tube; disruption of this spatial gradient of the transmembrane potential (Vmem) diminishes or eliminates the expression of early brain markers and causes anatomical mispatterning of the brain, including absent or malformed regions. This effect is mediated by voltage-gated calcium signaling and gap-junctional communication. In addition to cell-autonomous effects, we show that hyperpolarization of transmembrane potential (Vmem) in ventral cells outside the brain induces upregulation of neural cell proliferation at long range. Misexpression of the constitutively active form of Notch, a suppressor of neural induction, impairs the normal hyperpolarization pattern and neural patterning; forced hyperpolarization by misexpression of specific ion channels rescues brain defects induced by activated Notch signaling. Strikingly, hyperpolarizing posterior or ventral cells induces the production of ectopic neural tissue considerably outside the neural field. The hyperpolarization signal also synergizes with canonical reprogramming factors (POU and HB4), directing undifferentiated cells toward neural fate in vivo. These data identify a new functional role for bioelectric signaling in brain patterning, reveal interactions between Vmem and key biochemical pathways (Notch and Ca²⁺ signaling) as the molecular mechanism by which spatial differences of Vmem regulate organogenesis of the vertebrate brain, and suggest voltage modulation as a tractable strategy for intervention in certain classes of birth defects.",

      "text": "The embryonic CNS is a paradigm case of complex morphogenesis within which to decode the biophysical forces that enable pattern formation. Understanding the convergence of genetic and physiological signaling toward large-scale anatomy of the brain holds enormous biomedical potential for addressing birth defects and repairing injuries. The tightly orchestrated proliferation and expansion of the neural progenitor population underlie formation of a complex brain from the pseudostratified neuroepithelial tube (Joseph and Hermanson, 2010). Organ size and target morphology are precisely controlled in all life forms from plants to vertebrates (Stanger, 2008). Appropriate organ size is achieved through extensive proliferation, growth, and remodeling during development (Stanger, 2008; Joseph and Hermanson, 2010), but the mechanisms that encode this information and ensure appropriate size and morphology remain largely unknown. Both physical forces/properties (Thompson, 1942; Stanger, 2008), as well as genetic developmental programs (Zhao et al., 2011; Harvey and Hariharan, 2012), are involved. Here, we reveal a new morphogenetic role for transmembrane voltage potential as a regulator of brain morphogenesis and investigate the mechanisms by which Vmem distribution contributes to the development of the vertebrate brain.",

      "text": "The idea that spatiotemporal electrical gradients across tissue direct growth and form was proposed many decades ago (Burr, 1932). This has since been investigated in the context of electric fields' roles in cell migration, regeneration, and wound healing (McCaig et al., 2005; Pullar, 2011). Recently, a new aspect of developmental physiology—spatiotemporal patterns of transmembrane potential (Vmem) of cells across tissues in vivo—was revealed as a key regulator of patterning (Sundelacruz et al., 2009; Vandenberg and Levin, 2010; Beane et al., 2013; Levin, 2013; Tseng and Levin, 2013; Perathoner et al., 2014). Tightly regulated differences in Vmem among key cell groups establish anatomical polarity, positional information, and organ identity during vertebrate appendage regeneration (Monteiro et al., 2014; Perathoner et al., 2014), cancer initiation and metastasis (Brown et al., 1994; Brackenbury, 2012), eye formation (Nuckels et al., 2009; Vandenberg et al., 2011; Pai et al., 2012b), left-right patterning (Levin et al., 2002; Adams et al., 2006), and planarian head induction and patterning (Beane et al., 2013).",

      "text": "It has long been known that electrical spiking activity of neurons regulates neurogenesis (Deisseroth et al., 2004; Spitzer, 2006; Swapna and Borodinsky, 2012). Here, we asked whether the resting electrical properties of neural precursor cells, and importantly their neighbors, might regulate large-scale patterning of the CNS. Could information encoded in steady-state properties (not action potentials) of embryonic cells direct neural induction, differentiation, and gene expression during the formation of a complex brain? Embryos of *Xenopus laevis* are an excellent model for neurodevelopment and its disorders (Pratt and Khakhalin, 2013) and uniquely suited for biophysics experiments. Our data indicate that endogenous transmembrane potential gradients (Vmem) play important roles during neural induction and neural tissue development. These effects of Vmem change are mediated by gap junctions (GJ) and Ca²⁺ flux and regulate key transcription factors within developing neural tissue. Vmem levels also regulate tissue size via long-range control over cell proliferation. Remarkably, reinforcing these powerful endogenous signals can rescue brain morphology defects, while misexpression of ion channels induces ectopic neural tissue well outside the endogenous neural fields. These results suggest a new modality for therapeutic applications in nervous system development and disease.",

Capped synthetic mRNAs generated using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) were dissolved in nuclease-free water and injected into embryos immersed in 3% Ficoll using standard methods (Sive et al., 2000). Each injection delivered between 1 and 2 nl or 1–2 ng of mRNA (per blastomere) into the embryos, usually at the four-cell stage into the middle of the cell in the animal pole. Constructs used were as follows: constitutively active notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD; Beck and Slack, 1999), POU (Snir et al., 2006), HB4 (Jullien et al., 2010), Kv1.5 (Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2007), GlyR (Davies et al., 2003), dominant-negative Kir6.1 pore mutant (Aw et al., 2010), Bir10 (Fakler et al., 1996), 666 chimera (Hough et al., 2000), Nav1.5 (Onkal et al., 2008), H7 (Paul et al., 1995), and dominant-negative SERT mutant D98G (Barker et al., 1999; Fukumoto et al., 2005b). Kv1.5-β-galactosidase and Kv1.5-tomato were injected as single mRNAs (bicistronic constructs with a single polyA tail at the end) that produce separate proteins due to a viral peptide sequence (2A) inserted between the two cDNA sequences (de Felipe et al., 2006; Szymczak-Workman et al., 2012). Kv1.5 is a commonly used hyperpolarizing channel (Bertoli et al., 1994; Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2007; Pai et al., 2012b). GlyR is a particularly versatile reagent because it allows the experimental control of Vmem in either direction, using the GlyR opener drug ivermectin (IVM) (Shan et al., 2001) coupled with modulation of the extracellular chloride levels [Cl⁻]ex (Blackiston et al., 2011). The normally depolarizing effect of GlyR misexpression in standard *Xenopus* medium (0.4 mM) [Cl⁻] becomes a hyperpolarizing effect by incubating embryos in the presence of [Cl⁻]ex higher than intracellular chloride [Cl⁻]in (~60 mM) (Davies et al., 2003; Blackiston et al., 2011; Pai et al., 2012b) as this condition drives the influx of negative ions.",

      "text": "Cells lining the neural tube show specific hyperpolarization before neural tube closure in *Xenopus* A study of endogenous bioelectrical patterns during craniofacial development (Vandenberg et al., 2011) showed a strong hyperpolarization signal from the cells of the neural plate, as the neural folds are formed and close to form the neural tube. To characterize in detail the changes in diverse resting potential (Vmem) states across neural development, we used in vivo time-lapse imaging with the voltage-sensitive dye pair CC2-DMPE:DiBAC (Adams and Levin, 2012). During neurulation, the neural folds remain relatively depolarized while the neural plate cells exhibit hyperpolarization (Fig. 1A, blue arrows; n = 23); this begins as early as the start of neural fold formation (stage 12; data not shown) of *Xenopus* embryos; this signal progressively intensifies until the closure of the neural tube at which point the signal can no longer be seen (Fig. 1B,C; n = 10; Vandenberg et al., 2011). Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of Vmem from the neural plate cells (approximately −51 mV; stages 16–17) showed them to be hyperpolarized by ~40 mV compared with the neighboring cells (Fig. 1D; n = 5, *p* = 0.0001). The presence of distinct resting potentials across the neural plate, and the dynamic nature of Vmem change at these crucial stages of development, suggested that these gradients may function as regulators of induction and formation of neural tissue.",
