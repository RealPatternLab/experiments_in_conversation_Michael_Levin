Their relevance falls across three categories: contributing to basic evolutionary, cell, and developmental biology; serving as a sandbox for bioengineering, active matter, and synthetic morphology; and showing promise as a technology for sensing and delivery in biomedical settings. Biobots are categorized into three types: noncellular, hybrid, and fully cellular. Noncellular biobots are entirely robotic but inspired by biological forms, while hybrid biobots combine biological and inanimate components. Fully cellular biobots, like Xenobots and Anthrobots, rely solely on the inherent capacity of biological cells to adopt new forms and functions.",

Their relevance falls across three categories: contributing to basic evolutionary, cell, and developmental biology; serving as a sandbox for bioengineering, active matter, and synthetic morphology; and showing promise as a technology for sensing and delivery in biomedical settings. Biobots are categorized into three types: noncellular, hybrid, and fully cellular. Noncellular biobots are entirely robotic but inspired by biological forms, while hybrid biobots combine biological and inanimate components.
