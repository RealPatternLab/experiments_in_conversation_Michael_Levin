The platform uses laminar flow in a microfluidic channel to create a “sucrose gap\" that forces electrical signaling through a cell monolayer. Intercellular communication is detected through electrical impedance measurements. A phase sensitive homodyne system has been designed and simulated in a 130nm CMOS process to provide a readout of cell monolayer complex impedance within the device. The system exhibits a highly linear conversion rate of 0.589mV/kΩ for cell layer impedances up to 1 ΜΩ.",

      "text": "Non-neural cells possess sophisticated intercellular communication mechanisms mediated by gap junctions, which are close cytosolic couplings allowing the exchange of signaling molecules or ions between adjacent cells. These gap junctions, comprised of membrane proteins, play a crucial role in shaping cell development, impacting pattern formation, asymmetry, and organ growth. Errors in gap junction signaling can lead to abnormal growth and diseases like cancer. Regulation of these electrical synapses is essential for exploiting developmental bioelectricity for bioengineering artificial living constructs.",

Patch clamping disrupts the membrane and is technically challenging, while dye diffusion results are difficult to quantify and repeat. To overcome these limitations, a microfluidic platform is proposed for repeatable non-invasive assays on tissue networks. This platform electrically isolates a living cell culture, allowing precise impedance measurements that correspond to the average connectivity across the cells. This real-time monitoring enables closed-loop drug delivery studies to test training and anticipation in gap junction networks.",
