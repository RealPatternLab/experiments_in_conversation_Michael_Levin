The origin of these nerves and the mechanisms driving innervation are not well understood. This study uses retrograde labeling to show that mammary tumors have increased nerves from the dorsal root ganglia. TNBC cells trigger stress and activation markers in neurons and induce firing in a TRPV1-dependent manner. In vitro, TNBC cells promote sensory nerve outgrowth, which is blocked by Trpv1 knockout. c-Jun and IL-6 are identified as downstream effectors of TRPV1-mediated neurite outgrowth. In vivo, Trpv1 knockout mice show delayed tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis, suggesting TRPV1's critical role in tumor-nerve crosstalk and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

These nerves, including sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory nerves, can both promote and suppress tumor growth. Understanding the mechanisms driving tumor innervation could offer new strategies to combat metastatic disease. Breast cancer, particularly TNBC, is associated with increased sensory nerve fiber density and poorer prognosis.

Sensory nerve outgrowth into tumors is regulated by factors like neurotrophic factors, axon guidance molecules, ECM components, and bioelectric signals.

This growth is regulated by extrinsic cues, including neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF), axon guidance molecules (semaphorins, netrins), ECM components, and bioelectric signals.
