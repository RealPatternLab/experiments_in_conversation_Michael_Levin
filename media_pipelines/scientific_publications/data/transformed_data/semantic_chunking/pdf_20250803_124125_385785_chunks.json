GJ genes are expressed during development, establishing electrically isopotential compartments. GJs are crucial for tissue maintenance, regeneration, and left-right axis patterning. In invertebrates, innexins form functional GJ channels and are expressed throughout planaria, classified by expression pattern: gut, nervous system/blastema, and parenchyma/protonephridia. Inhibiting GJC in Dugesia japonica causes AP polarity respecification and two-headed planaria. Comparing this to altered head shape in Girardia dorotocephala reveals interesting differences.",
