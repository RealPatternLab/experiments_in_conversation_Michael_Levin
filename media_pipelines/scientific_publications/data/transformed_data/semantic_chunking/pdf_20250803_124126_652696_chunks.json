      "text": "Vertebrates exhibit bilateral symmetry externally, but their internal organs are asymmetrically positioned. This consistent asymmetry raises questions about its evolutionary origins, developmental mechanisms, and the implications for organ function and overall body plan. The establishment of left/right (LR) asymmetry involves three phases: the initial orientation of the LR axis, the activation of asymmetric gene expression cascades, and the morphogenetic processes that shape individual organs. The timing of these phases varies across species, but asymmetric gene expression typically begins around gastrulation. While the mechanisms underlying anterior-posterior and dorsoventral asymmetry are well-studied, the molecular basis of LR asymmetry has only recently begun to be elucidated.",
