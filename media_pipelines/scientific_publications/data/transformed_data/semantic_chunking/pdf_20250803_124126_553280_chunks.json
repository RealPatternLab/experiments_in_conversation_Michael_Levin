      "text": "The 6-ICH signature associated with tumor side consists of calcium, sodium, and potassium channels. CACNA1C, CACNA2D2, and CACNB2 are subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels involved in various physiological processes. KCNJ11 codes for a potassium channel regulating insulin secretion and has been proposed as a metastasis regulator in triple-negative breast cancer. SCN3A and SCN3B are subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels important for action potential propagation. Recent findings highlight the clinical importance of sodium channels and the ionic microenvironment of breast tumors.  Predicting the outcome of gene expression shifts in these ICH is complex and context-dependent. The 6-ICH signature's impact on membrane potential is influenced by the collective actions of ion channels and transporters. Lower signature expression correlates with more depolarized membrane potential, potentially due to reduced function of voltage-independent potassium channels like KCNJ11, triggering activation of voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels and maintaining a depolarized state involved in cell cycle progression.",

      "text": "Cancer cells tend to be more depolarized than normal counterparts. Fast-proliferating tumor cells exhibit depolarized membrane potential, while non- or less-proliferating cells are hyperpolarized. Depolarization is considered a signal for mitosis and DNA synthesis. Membrane potential also plays a role in stem cell differentiation, with hyperpolarization required for maturation and depolarization reducing the differentiated phenotype. Bioinformatic analyses showed that lower 6-ICH expression is associated with increased proliferation and stemness, and worse survival. Higher stemness indices are linked to increased cancer stem cells and a more de-differentiated phenotype, associated with worse prognosis and therapy resistance. Proliferation is crucial in BC evaluation, with KI67 as a key marker. The 6-ICH signature may modulate these processes by altering the bioelectric state in a side-dependent manner.",
