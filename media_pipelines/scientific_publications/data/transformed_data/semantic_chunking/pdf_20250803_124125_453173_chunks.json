      "text": "Living organisms exhibit remarkable abilities to detect, respond to, and adapt to variable environments, even without complex nervous systems. Examples include context-dependent motility in microbes, stress response-triggered learning, anticipation, long-range spatial decision-making, and associative learning. Even plants demonstrate complex adaptive responses through calcium signaling, synaptic adhesion domains, and action potentials, enabling self-identity and recognition capabilities, as well as detection of acoustic vibrations and subsequent defense mechanisms. The slime mold Physarum exhibits mechanosensing and makes growth decisions based on information about distant objects. These adaptations involve changes in motility, physical properties (chemical release, mechanical tension), bioelectric state, metabolic state, and transcriptional changes.",

Existing frameworks, such as Godfrey-Smith's cognitive lineage and Deacon's teleodynamic properties, lack a unified explanation or experimentally testable predictions. The research questions focus on the extent of pattern detection abilities in simple organisms, their capacity for expectations, and suitable frameworks for understanding these capacities. Pattern detection, a basic component of intelligence, allows organisms to infer general patterns from specific experiences, forming the basis for expectations. While seasonal and day-night cycles provide reliable patterns, the ability of aneural organisms to detect and adapt to novel patterns on shorter timescales remains unclear.",

      "text": "Environmental changes can influence both current and future cellular states. Phototactic organisms exemplify immediate responses, where light-induced protein conformational changes and flagellar beating adjustments lead to movement towards or away from light. Photoadaptation, the short-term adjustment of light sensitivity and flagellar response, is less well-studied in simpler organisms like Volvox compared to the human visual system. Patterned environmental stimuli with varying frequencies can elicit distinct signaling events and behavioral outcomes. Examples include frequency-specific yeast growth inhibition due to osmotic oscillations and optogenetic activation of signaling pathways influencing gene transcription. In Volvox, sinusoidal light stimulation has been used to study flagellar regulation, but its effects on colony behavior and responses to complex activation patterns remain unexplored.",

      "text": "This study adopts a top-down perspective, focusing on system responses to patterns and information content, using a cognitive Bayesian framework. Cellular beliefs, or predictions, encode expected signals, representing the cell's estimate of the most adaptable state. Regulatory output aims to minimize uncertainties in environmental measurements compared to expected inputs. Cellular expectations arise from internal signaling pathway dynamics, encoded by transcriptional dynamics and short-term protein conformational and activity changes. Transcriptional outputs and protein functional changes modify signaling transmission parameters. Uncertainty minimization predicts stronger, less directed responses to random stimulation compared to regular stimulation, leading to an aversion to irregular environments.",

Different light stimulation patterns, including randomized ones, were simulated and tested for their effects on phototactic modulation in V. carteri. An experimental platform compared Volvox phototaxis towards distinct light pulsation patterns, exploring mechanisms and long-term effects. Gain-of-function drug experiments investigated phototactic biases. The study also examined Volvox's short-term memory of light stimuli and the impact of dynamic light patterns on photosynthesis. Finally, the potential for training Volvox phototaxis using patterned electric shocks was explored. The overall aim is to reveal unexpected capacities in algae and provide a framework for studying such capacities in minimal and synthetic systems, linking basal cognition theories to experimental evidence and offering a testable behavioral directive for simple organisms and cells.",

V. aureus colonies were manually counted in different chamber sections. V. carteri experiments employed SK9822 addressable RGB LEDs (2 mW) with Arduino Nano controllers. Phototactic experiments used blue light (460 nm), while growth and oxygen measurements used both blue and red (650 nm) light.

Simulations of V. carteri photoadaptation used the model by Drescher et al. (2010), based on coupled differential equations governing flagella photoresponse. Fluid speed generated by flagella was calculated based on photoresponse and adaptation variables. Electric shock treatment involved a 3D-printed chamber with platinum iridium electrodes.

This suggests V. aureus can distinguish between patterned and random light stimuli, a fundamental aspect of intelligent information processing.  Volvox carteri also showed a similar bias towards regular light pulses (p < 0.01), indicating that this behavior is conserved across different Volvox species. A principal component analysis (PCA) of V. carteri colony size, swimming speed, and colony number revealed that larger colonies tend to swim faster and that colony density is largely independent of size and speed. Filtering for specific size and speed ranges (120-150 µm diameter, >120 µm/s speed) revealed the most effective distinction between random and patterned stimuli.",
