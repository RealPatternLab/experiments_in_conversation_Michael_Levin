      "text": "Collective intelligence and individual intelligence are often viewed as distinct, with individual intelligence residing in organisms with specialized neural systems evolved for cognitive functions and trained through experience. Collective intelligence, however, lacks a clear definition and often involves domain-specific mechanisms, as collectives are not typically evolutionary units and don't have a singular locus of reward. This paper argues that these distinctions are not absolute, using examples from evolution and developmental morphogenesis. It proposes a connectionist framework, borrowing from models of individual cognition and learning, to understand collective intelligence, emphasizing the emergent properties of cellular collectives as examples of sub-organismal collective intelligence.",

      "text": "The paper challenges the perceived distinction between individual and collective intelligence. It argues that individuals are collectives of parts that were once individuals themselves, from multicellular organisms to eukaryotic cells and even simpler cells with chromosomes.  Organismal function relies on the autonomy of these components.  Furthermore, all intelligences are collective, as even individual intelligence arises from the interaction of unintelligent components (neurons) in a specific organization, a core principle of connectionism.  Cognition and learning are substrate-independent, meaning the principles of distributed cognition can be implemented by any network with suitable signal and response arrangements.  Finally, the credit assignment problems in collective intelligence are also fundamental to individual adaptation and intelligence, suggesting a deeper connection between the two.",

      "text": "The paper proposes a formalism for understanding how collectives can behave like intelligent agents.  It suggests that intelligent systems operate with reward feedback at a higher level, selecting behaviors that benefit the whole system.  However, individual components within the system remain autonomous, acting based on individual rewards within their relational context. The key question is what interaction structures enable collectives to exhibit information integration and coordinated action for system-level reward. The paper argues that connectionist models can identify these relationships and the conditions for bottom-up collective intelligence without system-level feedback.",
