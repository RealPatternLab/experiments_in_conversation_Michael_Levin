Among the 4 HCN isoforms, HCN4 is known as a pacemaker channel, because it helps control the periodicity of contractions in vertebrate hearts. Although the physiological role of HCN4 channel has been studied in adult mammalian hearts, an earlier role during embryogenesis has not been clearly established. Here, we probe the embryonic roles of HCN4 channels, providing the first characterization of the expression profile of any of the HCN isoforms during Xenopus laevis development and investigate the consequences of altering HCN4 function on embryonic pattern formation. We demonstrate that both overexpression of HCN4 and injection of dominant-negative HCN4 mRNA during early embryogenesis results in improper expression of key patterning genes and severely malformed hearts. Our results suggest that HCN4 serves to coordinate morphogenetic control factors that provide positional information during heart morphogenesis in Xenopus.",

Expressed predominantly in the nervous system and heart, 4 genes encoding HCN isoforms (HCN1–4) have been identified in mammals, which have differential tissue-specific expression and functionality. Functional channels are composed of 4 subunits that are arranged around a centrally located pore. HCN channels are permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+, and produce currents (known as If [funny current] in the heart and Ih in the nervous system) that have a variety of physiological functions, such as regulating the spontaneous depolarization of adult heart and nerve cells. HCN4 and HCN2 are the most abundant isoforms in mammalian adult hearts and are distributed in all regions of the heart that undergo spontaneous firing (known as the cardiac conduction system).",

      "text": "In addition to their well-characterized roles in adult tissues, several studies have reported that HCN4 and HCN2 are also expressed during early stages of both murine and chick embryogenesis. For example, in mouse embryos, HCN4 mRNA is first expressed in progenitors of the primary heart field during gastrulation, well before the heart begins to beat. At the beginning of cardiac looping, it is asymmetrically expressed on the left side of the sinus venosus, but this asymmetry is reversed to the right side by the end of looping. Although HCN2 becomes the dominant isoform in the hearts of mouse neonates, HCN4 continues to be expressed in the developing heart, with its expression becoming progressively restricted to the cardiac conductive system. Thus, in addition to its pacemaker function, HCN4 channels likely play an earlier role during the development of the embryonic heart. Because HCN4 knockout in mice leads to lethality before heart maturation, investigating novel embryonic roles of HCN4 has been challenging in animals with in utero development.",

As development proceeds, these 2 heart precursor fields merge at the ventral midline to create the primary heart tube. Before the bilateral precardiac fields merge, the expression of transcription factors such as Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 initiate the program for differentiation of the cardiac mesoderm.

HCN4's asymmetric expression the cardiac crescent in mice before heart tube formation suggests that it might also regulate organ position within the body. Further evidence suggesting a role for HCN4 during development is the fact that bioelectric signaling through ion channels has been shown to play a critical role during tissue formation, patterning, and organogenesis. These signals establish membrane potentials and voltage gradients in cells through the unequal distribution of ions across the plasma membrane. Mutations in ion channels can lead to serious impairments during embryonic development. For example, mutating a Na+/K+-ATPase ion pump leads to abnormalities in heart tube extension, cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac function in zebrafish embryos. Mutations in numerous ion channels induce a variety of channelopathies which manifest in human patients and model species as birth defects affecting various organs' patterning.",

      "text": "Because mice lacking functional HCN4 channels die during embryonic development between E9.5-E11.5, it has been postulated that this lethality results from atypical cardiac function. While HCN4 function is essential for normal pacemaker activity, in both mice and chickens HCN4 is expressed very early in development, well before heart beating is initiated. To investigate the possibility that HCN4 channels play an additional and earlier role during cardiogenesis, a spatio-temporal analysis via whole-mount in situ hybridization of HCN4 mRNA expression was performed in Xenopus laevis during embryogenesis. HCN4 transcripts were first robustly detected in the developing craniofacial region, in 2 bilateral stripes along the neural tube, and in the developing somites at the end of neurulation (NF stage 21, Fig. 1A). The craniofacial and somite expression pattern remained consistent throughout later tailbud and tadpole stages (NF stages 25-39, Fig. 1A and B). Expression in the notochord was discernible in tailbud stages (e,g., NF stages 25 and 27) and persisted throughout tadpole stages (Fig. 1A-D). Beginning at NF stage 26, HCN4 transcripts were present in the presumptive heart region, where they were restricted to the left side of the developing cardiac field. Shortly thereafter expression became bilateral in the heart field (NF stage 27, Fig. 1A) but remained higher on the left side throughout the later stages of heart development (Fig. 1B). HCN4 expression was diffusely present in the myocardium at the completion of heart tube formation (NF stage 29/30, Fig. 1B). This myocardial expression remained throughout cardiac looping and chamber septation (NF stage 34 and stage 38/39, Fig. 1B). Unlike what has been observed in mice, HCN4 expression never became more highly expressed on the right side of the developing heart.",

      "text": "As the sections in Fig. 1C illustrate, when cardiac differentiation is beginning during late tailbud stages, HCN4 expression in the developing cardiac mesoderm was similar to what has been described for other primary heart field markers including: Nkx2.5, MLC2a, Tbx5, and Tbx20. However, as differentiation and looping progress, HCN4 expression was observed in both the myocardial tissue, as well as the septum transversum, the area where proepicardial precursor cells are located (Fig. 1D). The pattern of HCN4 expression observed at these stages is nearly identical to another marker of the septum transversurm, the epicardial-associated transcription factor Tbx18 (NF stage 34, Fig. 1B). We further confirmed HCN4s myocardial expression by examining the protein distribution in the heart via immunohistochemistry. HCN4 protein was expressed in the myocardium at NF stage 35, and later at NF stage 46 when heart maturation was complete (Fig. 1E). In both stages, HCN4 was robustly expressed throughout the myocardium. Interestingly, similar to what has been described in neonatal mouse and rat hearts, the HCN2 protein was also highly expressed in the myocardium in NF stage 46 tadpoles (Fig. 1E). Although HCN2 was robustly expressed in the developing nervous system and notochord at tailbud stages, HCN2 channel expression was not detected in the developing heart region during early stages of cardiogenesis in Xenopus (between NF stages 26-34, Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, in addition to its established role in patterning the cardiac conduction system, the expression of HCN4 and not HCN2, in the developing heart field before the formation of a beating heart tube is consistent with additional embryonic roles during Xenopus cardiogenesis.",

      "text": "In humans, inherited mutations in the gene encoding HCN4 have been shown to cause sinus node dysfunction. For example, patients who carry a missense D553N mutation or a G480R point mutation develop cardiac arrhythmias. G480 is one of the conserved amino acid residues within the “GYG” signature cation selectivity motif of the pore region across species. This motif is common to an array of potassium-permeable channels, and has previously been used to generate dominant negative constructs for other HCN isoforms (Fig. 2A). We generated the triple amino acid mutant (“GYG” to “AAA”), and used voltage clamping in HEK293 cells, which do not have endogenous HCN expression, to characterize whether the HCN4-DN (AAA) mutant displayed a dominant-negative effect (Fig. 2B). Characteristic IHCN4 currents were generated in cells transfected with wildtype HCN4 in response to successive hyperpolarizing voltage steps, where larger voltage steps produced larger channel conductance. In contrast, in the HCN4-DN(AAA) expressing cells, the mutant channel showed little IHCN4 currents, with currents that were at the same magnitude as the negative vector control (pcDNA3, Fig. 2B). We then tested whether the HCN4-DN(AAA) could act as a true dominant-negative construct by co-transfecting it with the wildtype channel. If the HCN4-AAA mutant successfully integrated with wildtype subunits to form non-functional channels, then the currents observed with just HCN4-WT expression alone should be abolished. Indeed, when the mutant channel was co-expressed with the HCN4-WT channel (at 1:1 DNA ratio during transfection), the hybrid channel did not yield significant IHCN4 currents (Fig. 2B-C; n = 4, *p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that the HCN4-AAA mutant can result in a dominant negative effect. Thus, the HCN4-DN(AAA) mutation was subsequently used to manipulate channel function in Xenopus embryos.",

To determine if the sidedness of perturbation was important, membrane-bound RFP (mem-RFP) was co-injected as a lineage tracer to confirm location of expression in injected animals, and embryos were sorted for fluorescence on the left vs. the right side of the body. Heart morphology was examined after the completion of chamber septation (NF stage 46) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a Cardiac Troponin-T antibody (myocardial tissue) that allows visualization of mature heart structures. Both injection conditions induced abnormal cardiac phenotypes including twisted hearts, rotated hearts, unlooped hearts, and hearts with double ventricles (Fig. 3Aii-v respectively). Although tadpoles with malformed hearts were seen when HCN4 was overexpressed, abnormal heart phenotypes were observed less frequently in HCN-OE injected animals than in the HCN4-DN(AAA) expressing tadpoles (Fig. 3B).

Thus, altering the endogenous area of HCN4 function during early stages of cardiogenesis results aberrant heart phenotypes, even when injected mRNAs are expressed outside of the heart region in mature tadpoles. We conclude that HCN4 function is an important endogenous input into heart patterning, and that HCN4-dependent signaling functions at considerable distance (non-cell-autonomously). To examine whether the abnormal heart morphology resulted from the global mispatterning of embryonic tissues, the expression of several genes expressed during different stages of development was examined in HCN4-DN(AAA)-injected embryos (Supplemental Figure 2). The expression pattern of both Xbra, a pan-mesodermal gene activated during gastrulation, and Otx2, a broad anterior structure marker expressed during gastrulation and neurulation, was similar to uninjected control embryos (Supplemental Figure 2A). Similarly, Nkx2.5 expression, which is an important cardiac field specification gene, was not affected by injection of HCN4-DN(AAA) during early cardiogenesis (NF stage 27), or later cardiac looping (NF stage 32). In addition, the presence of a myocardial-specific protein (CT3) in HCN4-altered animals (Figs. 3 and 4) provides further support that myocardial differentiation proceeded normally.",

      "text": "A critical step of creating functional organs during development is the final placement of organs inside the body cavity. All organs are dependent on surrounding tissues to provide the spatial cues needed to regulate growth, cell fate, and determine organ position. Previous research has demonstrated that altering the location of proteins that direct laterality decisions during development often results in the misplacement of organs. Because altering HCN4 channel function resulted in the formation of misplaced, but properly differentiated myocardial tissue at swimming tadpole stages, and the endogenous channel is asymmetrically expressed in the heart field during early cardiogenesis, we investigated whether HCN4 interacts with canonical determinants of organ laterality during embryogenesis. Xnr-1 is one of the earliest regulators of laterality, and its left-sided expression is required for cardiogenesis to progress normally. Therefore, we examined the expression pattern of Xnr-1 at stages when it is asymmetrically expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm at the completion of neurulation (NF stage 21) in animals injected with either the HCN4-OE or HCN4-DN(AAA) (Fig. 6). Injection of HCN4-DN(AAA) induced significantly higher percentages of abnormal, ectopic patterns of Xnr-1 expression compared with uninjected sibling embryos, including: complete bilateral fields, right-sided expression, and punctate Xnr-1 expression in both the lateral plate mesoderm as well as in dorsal region of the larvae (x² = 31.0207, df = 4, *p < 0.05). Interestingly, injecting the dominant-negative mRNA on the right-side of the body induced the highest percentage of abnormal Xnr-1 expression phenotypes (Fig. 6B) with over 50% of HCN4-DN (right) injected embryos with abnormal ectopic Xnr-1 expression, although this was not statistically different than injection on the left side of the body. While Xnr-1 expression was occasionally altered in HCN4-OE injected animals, these were not statistically different from uninjected embryos (Fig. 6B).",

We also observed punctate dots of Xnr-1 expression in injected embryos that were located outside of the normal Xnr-1 field including: along the midline (Fig. 6A, iii red arrowhead), in the posterior, and along the flanks of embryos. This ectopic, spotty Xnr-1 expression outside of the lateral plate mesoderm ranged from one or 2 punctate areas of expression to multiple spots. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ectopic, punctate Xnr-1 expression, as other previous studies report only the presence of bilateral expression or reversed, right-sided expression in response to genetic manipulations. Lefty is another patterning gene, which is activated by Xnr-1 and acts to limit the spatial distribution and duration of Xnr-1 signaling. Its left-sided expression acts as a barrier to Xnr-1 at the midline, preventing the transduction of \\\"left\\\" signals to the right half of the body. Lefty is expressed throughout organogenesis, propagating the polarity established by Xnr-1 through interactions with other downstream factors such as Pitx2 and BMP-4. To determine if HCN4 regulates the spatial organization of Lefty expression in a similar fashion to Xnr-1, we investigated Lefty expression at stages when both HCN4 and Lefty transcripts are present in the cardiac mesoderm (NF stage 27, Figs. 1 and 7, respectively). Both overexpression and injection of the dominant-negative mRNA resulted in bilateral Lefty expression. As observed with Xnr-1, there was a range in the severity of bilateral expression. Some embryos had a partial second Lefty field with a gap in expression along the midline (Fig. 7A, ii). However, in other embryos, Lefty expression appeared extremely disorganized and encompassed a large area of the anterior-ventral surface of the animal, including the midline (Fig. 7A, iii). All injection conditions generated significantly higher percentages of abnormal Lefty expression compared with uninjected sibling controls (Fig. 7B, x² = 19.0086, df = 4, p < 0.05).

      "text": "After axis-patterning genes such as Xnr-1 and Lefty help to establish sidedness in the body, organ morphogenesis must also be carefully regulated such that final organ asymmetry occurs correctly. Two critical mediators of these events, Pitx2 and BMP-4, directly translate asymmetric gene expression into asymmetric morphogenesis in multiple species through independent and coordinated interactions. Both Pitx2 and BMP-4 are regulated by Xnr-1 signaling, and work together to impart laterality to the developing heart tube. Both of these genes are asymmetrically expressed along the left side of the heart tube, providing laterality to the tube just before the onset of rightward looping. Because misexpression of either gene leads to severe positional defects in embryonic hearts, we examined the expression of Pitx2 and BMP-4 in HCN4-OE and HCN4-DN(AAA) injected embryos. To characterize the relationship of HCN4 expression to Pitx2 expression, we examined NF stage 27 embryos in HCN4-OE and HCN4-DN(AAA) injected animals. Both overexpression and injection of the dominant-negative construct resulted in significantly higher percentages of abnormal Pitx2 expression patterns compared with uninjected sibling control animals (Fig. 8, x² = 64.71, df = 4, *p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the overexpression and dominant-negative conditions, or sidedness of injection, all of which resulted in altered Pitx2 expression. Phenotypes included an expansion or reduction in the size of the endogenous field and bilateral expression (Fig. 8A, ii, iii, v). Similar to the Xnr-1 and Lefty results, the bilateral fields were not always equivalent in size. Many embryos had only a small, partial field on the right side of the body in addition to the endogenous field. No animals were observed to have a complete ablation of Pitx2 expression.",

      "text": "Because BMP-4 transcripts have a dynamic spatio-temporal pattern during critical stages of heart development and morphogenesis, we examined its expression profile in injected embryos at 3 different stages of heart development: before the onset of looping (NF stage 27), during looping while expression is asymmetric in the myocardium (NF stage 32), and after the completion of cardiac looping (NF stage 35). In uninjected embryos, BMP-4 has a bilateral, wing-shaped pattern beginning at NF stage 27 (Fig. 9A, i). This pattern becomes increasingly more distinct as looping progress with an area of asymmetric expression arising in the myocardium during these stages (Fig. 9B, i, yellow arrow). At the completion of looping (NF stage 35), the wing-pattern remains in the tissue surrounding the heart, and expression becomes more uniform around the outside layer of the myocardium (Fig. 9C, i). As Fig. 9D illustrates, all 3 stages investigated had significantly higher percentages of abnormal expression of BMP-4 in injected animals (HCN4-OE and HCN4-DN[AAA]) compared with uninjected sibling controls (NF stage 27: x² = 32.4768, df = 4; NF stage 32: x² = 82.2366, df = 4; NF stage 35: x² = 36.0791, df = 4, All: *p < 0.05). Similar abnormal BMP-4 expression phenotypes were observed in animals injected with the overexpression or the dominant-negative mRNA (no statistical difference between HCN4-OE and HCN4-DN[AAA] conditions, or left vs. right sided injections). Altering HCN4 function resulted in a global mispatterning of BMP-4 expression that included either a reduction in BMP-4 expression or loss of definition in the boundaries of the field (Fig. 9A ii-iii, 9B ii-iii, 9C ii-iii). There was no clear pattern in the location of reduction in embryos; BMP-4 was reduced on either side or both sides in individual embryos. When there was a loss in field definition the canonical wing-shaped BMP-4 pattern was no longer distinguishable; however, the area of BMP-4 expression that lost definition was not consistent across individuals. Frequently, BMP-4 expression was a disorganized smear across the ventral side, without wings or separation along the midline. We also observed a randomization or loss of asymmetric BMP-4 expression in the myocardium at stage 32, which may have important implications for final heart morphology. Finally, by stage 35, although the majority of embryos had uniform BMP-4 expression in the myocardium, heart looping was abnormal (Fig. 9C ii-iii).",

      "text": "Interestingly, the disruption of normal dorsal-anterior development, resulting in a reduction of anterior structures and loss of anterior notochord, results in abnormal heart left-right asymmetry. During embryogenesis, Shh signaling helps to establish the dorsoventral axis, and patterns the midline, including the central nervous system and notochord. Thus, to examine if the aberrant heart phenotypes observed in our experiments were due to a global mispatterning of the anterior, dorsal-midline, we examined the expression of Shh at several times during heart development. Embryos injected with HCN4-OE or HCN4-DN(AAA) were examined for Shh expression at 3 time points: during gastrulation, at the completion of neurulation, and during cardiac looping (Supplemental Figure 2B). In all stages examined, Shh expression was similar in uninjected control and injected animals suggesting the dorsal midline structures were not altered in these experiments. Taken together, these data illustrate that altering HCN4 channel function during embryogenesis results in atypical positional orientation and morphogenesis of the heart. Importantly, the phenotypes observed in HCN4-DN(AAA) injected animals have a unique heart morphology when compared with what has been previously observed in studies that disrupted canonical laterality genes. For example, ectopic right-sided Xnr-1 expression randomizes heart situs but the hearts are still properly looped. Similarly, overexpression of Lefty on either side of the body induces heart reversals (situs inversus) but proper looping and patterning is again maintained. In contrast, overexpression of Pitx2 can cause reversal in heart laterality, straightened outflow tracts, and leads to chamber malrotation. Likewise, inhibition of BMP-4 or its receptors results in a lack of cardiac looping and misplacement of the atria along the midline. Remarkably, the phenotypes we observed in embryos where HCN4 expression is disrupted appear to be a combination of inappropriate signals during both the patterning of early embryonic fields as well as later events during cardiac morphogenesis such as looping (Fig. 3).",

Both HCN4-OE and HCN4-DN(AAA) injected embryos expressed the mature myocardial protein, cardiac troponin-T, as well as the cardiac field marker Nkx2.5, indicating that differentiation occurred. In addition, the indistinguishable expression patterns of Xbra, Otx2, and Shh between injected animals and sibling controls suggest that HCN4 isn't arbitrarily disrupting axis formation, or germ layer specification, but rather it is specifically interacting with the genes that determine organ positioning. Physiologically, only injection of HCN4-DN(AAA) significantly affected heart rate, with injected embryos displaying tachycardia. Tachycardia has also been described in human HCN4 loss of function mutations: a c-linker interaction mutant and a trafficking-defective mutant. Importantly, both mutations occurred endogenously in patients, and the c-linker mutation was inherited across 4 generations of affected individuals. This suggests that the presence of a functioning HCN4 channel is required to properly pattern the cardiac conduction system, and this role is highly conserved across vertebrates; however, it is also possible that the abnormal heart rate is due to disrupted heart morphology or vice versa.",

      "text": "Our results demonstrating the altered expression of numerous morphogenetic control factors suggest a novel role for HCN4 during embryogenesis: coordinating the positional identity of cells needed to create functional organs via directing the distribution of important patterning molecules. The distribution of key signaling factors appears to be dependent on the correct function of HCN4 as both perturbations (overexpression and dominant-negative) induced similar phenotypes. Although Lefty, Pitx2, and BMP-4 expression was disrupted in embryos overexpressing HCN4, it seems that embryos can somewhat compensate for these molecular aberrations because many of the embryos in those populations were able to form normal hearts. This form of compensation has recently been described in Xenopus organ laterality, where disruptions in upstream gene signaling did not always induce downstream changes in organ situs. In sharp contrast, embryos with the dominant-negative construct ultimately have abnormal heart morphology, positioning and heart physiology. Combined, these data indicate that HCN4 channel function is required for the correct distribution of morphogenetic patterning genes during cardiogenesis, and contributes to directing final heart morphology. It should be noted that because Xnr-1 is upstream of Lefty, Pitx2, and BMP-4, it is possible that HCN4 interacts with Xnr-1 primarily, and subsequent changes in gene expression are a result of disrupted Xnr-1 signaling.",
