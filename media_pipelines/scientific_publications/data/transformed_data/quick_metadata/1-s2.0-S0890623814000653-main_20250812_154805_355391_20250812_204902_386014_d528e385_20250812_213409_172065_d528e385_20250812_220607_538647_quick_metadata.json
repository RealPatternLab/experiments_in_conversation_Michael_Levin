  "abstract": "Maternal use of anticonvulsants during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an elevated risk of major congenital malformations in the offspring. Whether the increased risk is caused by genetic or environmental risk factors shared by epilepsy and malformations has been controversial. We propose a novel hypothesis of teratogenicity of anticonvulsants based on their effects on the bioelectrically-controlled developmental processes involved in morphogenesis and organogenesis and propose the neurotransmission might lead to both better seizure control in the mother and stronger alteration of embryonic development. This hypothesis suggests several avenues of research to investigate mechanisms that result in safer drug development of pharmaceuticals that do not alter cell resting transmembrane voltage levels could.",
