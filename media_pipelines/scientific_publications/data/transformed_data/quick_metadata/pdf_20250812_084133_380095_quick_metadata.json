  "abstract": "Recent discussions and debate around artificial intelligence (AI) and its status are often limited by unexamined assumptions. Herein, it is argued that AI will emerge as fields of diverse intelligences (DI) and morphologies, as well as flourishing in impossible without an appreciation of the space of possible beings and of the ways in which today’s old narratives of what humans are and how to create new forms disrupt unbelievable intelligence machine debates and universal values picking.  This has important implications for humanity’s future as it will create a wide set of unconventional minds and minds is people modify to recognize their sentient allies in unfamiliar guises. Herein, the issues engendered by the advent of AI from the perspective of the field of DI and the evolutionary history of the bodies and minds are discussed.",
