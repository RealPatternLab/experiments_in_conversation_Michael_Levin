  "abstract": "Maternal use of anticonvulsants during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an elevated risk of major congenital malformations in the offspring. Whether the increased risk is caused by genetic or environmental risk factors shared by epilepsy and malformations has been controversial. We propose that the disruption of bioelectrically-mediated cellular processes during embryogenesis increases the risk of teratogenesis. This mechanism may provide an explanation for the heterogeneity of anticonvulsant-related developmental abnormalities and may better guide efforts in controlling and monitoring seizure disorders. This result is consistent with the increasing realization of the central role of bioelectrical signaling in morphogenesis and suggests that development of pharmaceuticals that do not alter cell resting transmembrane voltage levels could result in safer drugs.",
