  "abstract": "Nonlinearity is a characteristic of complex biological regulatory networks that has implications ranging from therapy to control of better understanding its nature, we analyzed a suite of published Boolean network models, containing a variety of complex nonlinear interactions, with an approach leveraging the continuous-nature of this formulation using Taylor-decomposition methods revealed the distinct layers of nonlinearity of the models. A comparison of the resulting series of model-specific coefficients with those derived from a large family of random networks demonstrated that biological networks are relatively more linearly controllable. We hypothesize that this is a result of optimization by natural selection for the purpose of controllability.",
