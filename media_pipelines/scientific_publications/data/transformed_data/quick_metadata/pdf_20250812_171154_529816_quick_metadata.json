  "abstract": "Many organisms can regenerate their bodies, but it is currently unclear how they accomplish this feat. In this paper, we introduce a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that maintains, in the light of random cell death, even a very complex 3D body plan in simulation. We propose an agent-based model that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for Planarian worm-like shapes, but the",
