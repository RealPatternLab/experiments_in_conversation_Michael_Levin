  "abstract": "Electroceuticals derived from applications of neuronal signaling, is a term coined to describe the therapeutic manipulation of neuronal electricals. In recent years, the complexity and range of electrical pharmaceuticals have grown considerably. This comprehensive view will aid in identifying greater coherence that brings together different frameworks to accelerate interventions and suggests broader more inclusive neuron-targeted interventions is suggested. This concept beyond neuro-aim to provide progress in this field. It is suggested that electroceuticals can be categorized into: cellular, tissue, organ and systems levels to provide a structured platform and systemic directions are discussed for each category of electroceutical and future. Emerging developments from a pharmaceutical industry perspective. Potential challenges of clinical biomarkers and translation of electroceuticals, such as a lack of selection criteria for inclusion of electroceuticals in clinical trials are highlighted often and stimulates understanding in this exciting field.",
