  "abstract": "Despite the immense progress in genetics and cell biology, major knowledge gaps remain with respect to predicting the large-scale anatomical outcomes of genetic or cellular manipulations. Morphogenesis is governed by a complex interplay between gene products and biophysical forces, and our understanding is limited by a focus on standard model systems that exhibit invariant species-specific anatomies.",
