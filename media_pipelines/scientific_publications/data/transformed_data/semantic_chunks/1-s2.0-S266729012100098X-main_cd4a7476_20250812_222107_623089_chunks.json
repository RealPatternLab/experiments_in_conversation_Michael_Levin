      "text": "Chimerism has several consequences: highlighting knowledge gaps in pure systems, creating opportunities to improve predictive understanding of morphogenesis and decision-making, and providing novel model systems outside Earth's evolutionary history.  Key questions arise about how anatomical setpoints are established in mixed collectives, how genomes function in novel environments, and what new aspects of cooperation and competition are revealed.  The ability to mix biological components emphasizes the plasticity of life and its capacity to produce adaptive structure and function in new circumstances.",

This, along with competition within bodies, promotes a systems view of interacting components across boundaries.  Chimeras demonstrate the ease of producing biological novelty, suggesting that components can be evolved individually and recombined later, a powerful property exploited by both engineers and evolution.",

In silico evolution and design of bioengineered organisms will illuminate the plasticity of genomic exploitation of physics and cellular decision-making.  Chimeric assembloids will provide basic knowledge for biomedical control of complex outcomes.  Advances in this area benefit basic biology, biomedicine, and robotics, particularly in designing and controlling multi-scale robotic swarms.
