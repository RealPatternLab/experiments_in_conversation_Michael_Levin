Abstract
We prove that for every abelian group G and every compactum X with
dimg X ≤ n ≥ 2 there is a G-acyclic resolution r : Z → X from a compactum
Z with dimg Z < n and dim Z < n + 1 onto X.

Keywords: cohomological dimension, acyclic resolution

[PAGE 1] Introduction
Spaces denoted by X are assumed to be separable metrizable. A compactum is a
metrizable compact space.

Let G be an abelian group. A space X has the cohomological dimension dimg X <
n if Hn+1(X, A; G) = 0 for every closed subset A of X. The case G = Z is an
important special case of cohomological dimension. It was known long ago that
dim X = dimz X if X is finite dimensional. Solving an outstanding problem in
cohomological dimension theory Dranishnikov constructed in 1987 an infinite di-
mensional compactum of dimz = 3. A few years earlier a deep relation between
dimz and dim was established by the Edwards cell-like resolution theorem [4, 8]
saying that a compactum of dimz ≤ n can be obtained as the image of a cell-like
map defined on a compactum of dim ≤ n. A compactum X is cell-like if any map
f : X → K from X to a CW-complex K is null homotopic. A map is cell-like if its
fibers are cell-like. The reduced Čech cohomology groups of a cell-like compactum
are trivial with respect to any group G.

Acyclic resolutions originated in the Edwards cell-like resolution. A compactum
X is G-acyclic if H*(X;G) = 0 and a map is G-acyclic if its fibers are G-acyclic.
Thus a cell-like map is G-acyclic with respect to any abelian group G. By the
Vietoris-Begle theorem a G-acyclic map cannot raise the cohomological dimension
dimg. Dranishnikov proved the following important

Theorem 1.1 ([2, 3]) Let X be a compactum with dimą X ≤ n, n ≥ 2. Then there
are a compactum Z with dimą Z < n and dim Z < n + 1 and a Q-acyclic map
r: Z → X from Z onto Χ.


[PAGE 2] 
It has been widely conjectured that Theorem 1.1 holds for any abelian group G.
A substantial progress in solving this conjecture was made by Koyama and Yokoi
[5] who proved it for a large class of groups including Q and very recently by Rubin
and Schapiro [7] who settled the case G = Zpo∞.

The purpose of this note is to finally answer this conjecture affirmatively by
proving

Theorem 1.2 Let G be an abelian group and let X be a compactum with dimg X <
n, n ≥ 2. Then there are a compactum Z with dimg Z ≤ n and dim Z < n + 1 and
a G-acyclic map r : Z → X from Z onto X.

In general the dimension n+1 of Z in Theorem 1.2 is best possible [5]. However,
it is unknown if the dimension of Z in Theorem 1.1 can be reduced to n. In this
connection let us also mention the following interesting result of Dranishnikov.

Theorem 1.3 ([1]) Let X be a compactum with dimz, X ≤ n. Then there are a
compactum Z with dim Z < n and a Zp-acyclic map r : Z → X from Z onto X.

Our proof of Theorem 1.2 essentially uses Dranishnikov's idea of constructing a Q-
acyclic resolution presented in [3] and involves some methods of [6]. The proof is
self-contained and does not rely on previous results concerning acyclic resolutions.
The paper [3] is an excellent source of basic information on cohomological dimension
theory.


[PAGE 2] Preliminaries
All groups below are abelian and functions between groups are homomorphisms.
P stands for the set of primes. For a non-empty subset A of P let S(A) =
{pp...pk: pi ∈ A,ni ≥ 0} be the set of positive integers with prime factors
from A and for the empty set define S(Ø) = {1}. Let G be a group and g ∈ G. We
say that g is A-torsion if there is n ∈ S(A) such that ng = 0 and g is A-divisible
if for every n ∈ S(A) there is h∈ G such that nh = g. TorĄG is the subgroup of
the A-torsion elements of G. G is A-torsion if G = TorĄG, G is A-torsion free if
Tor AG = 0 and G is A-divisible if every element of G is A-divisible.

Proposition 2.1
(i) If G is A-torsion then G is (P \A)-divisible and (P \ A)-torsion free.
(ii) A factor group of an A-divisible group is A-divisible and a factor group of
an A-torsion group is A-torsion.
(iii) The direct sum of A-divisible groups is A-divisible and the direct sum of
A-torsion groups is A-torsion.

Let f : G → H be a homomorphism of groups G and H and let H be B-torsion.
Then G/TorßG is


[PAGE 3] 
(iv) A-divisible if ker f is A-divisible and B ⊆ A;
(v) A-torsion if ker f is A-torsion and B ∩ A = ∅;
(vi) A-torsion and A-divisible if ker f is A-torsion and A-divisible and B ∩ A = ∅.

Proof. The proof of (i), (ii), (iii) is obvious.
Let φ : G → G/TorßG be the projection and f(x) = y. Then there is n ∈ S(B)
such that nf(x) = f(nx) = 0 and hence nx ∈ ker f.
(iv) Let m ∈ S(A). Since B ⊆ A, nm ∈ S(A). Then there is z ∈ ker f
such that nmz = nx. Hence n(mz - x) = 0 and therefore φ(mz − x) = 0. Thus
mφ(z) = φ(x) = y and G/TorßG is A-divisible.
(v) By (i) ker f is (P \ A)-divisible and therefore there is z ∈ ker f such that
nz = nx. Then n(z - x) = 0 and there is m ∈ S(A) such that mz = 0. Hence
φ(z) = φ(x) = y and my = φ(mz) = 0 and (v) follows.
(vi) By (v) G/TorßG is A-torsion. By (i) ker f is (P \ A)-divisible and since
ker f is A-divisible, ker f is P-divisible. Then by (iv) G/TorßG is A-divisible.

The notation e-dimX < Y is used to indicate the property that every map
f : A → Y of a closed subset A of X into Y extends over X. It is known that
dimg X ≤ n if and only if e-dimX < K(G, n) where K(G, n) is the Eilenberg-MacLane complex of type (G, n). A map between CW-complexes is combinatorial if the
preimage of every subcomplex of the range is a subcomplex of the domain.

Let M be a simplicial complex and let M[n] be the n-skeleton of M (=the union
of all simplexes of M of dim ≤ n). By a resolution EW(M, n) of M we mean a CW-
complex EW(M,n) and a combinatorial map ω : EW(M,n) → M such that ω is
1-to-1 over M[n]. The resolution is said to be suitable for a map f : M[n] → Y if the
map f◦ω|ω⁻¹(M[n]) extends to a map from EW(M, n) to Y. The resolution is said to
be suitable for a compactum X if for every simplex Δ of M, e-dimX < ω⁻¹(Δ).
Note that if ω : EW(M,n) → M is a resolution suitable for X then for every map
ϕ : X → M there is a map ψ : X → EW(M, n) such that for every simplex Δ of
Μ, (ω◦ψ)(ϕ⁻¹(Δ)) ⊂ Δ. We will call ψ a combinatorial lifting of ϕ.

Following [6] we will construct a resolution of an (n + 1)-dimensional simplicial
complex M which is suitable for X with dimg X ≤ n and a map f : M[n] →
K(G, n). In the sequel we will refer to this resolution as the standard resolution for
f. Fix a CW-structure on K(G, n) and assume that f is cellular. We will obtain
a CW-complex EW(M,n) from M[n] by attaching the mapping cylinder of f|∂Δ to
Δ for every (n + 1)-simplex Δ of M. Let ω : EW(M,n) → M be the projection
sending each mapping cylinder to the corresponding (n+1)-simplex Δ such that ω is
the identity map on ∂Δ, the K(G, n)-part of the cylinder is sent to the barycenter of
Δ and ω is 1-to-1 on the rest of the cylinder. Clearly f|∂Δ extends over its mapping
cylinder and therefore f◦ω|ω⁻¹(M[n]) extends over EW(M, n). For each simplex Δ
of M, ω⁻¹(Δ) is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to K(G, n). Define a


[PAGE 4] 
CW-structure on EW(M, n) turning ω into a combinatorial map. Thus we get that
the standard resolution is indeed a resolution suitable for both X and f. Note that
from the construction of the standard resolution ω : EW(M,n) → M it follows
that for every subcomplex T of M, ω⁻¹(T) is the standard resolution of T for f|T[n]
and ω⁻¹(T) is (n - 1)-connected if T is (n − 1)-connected.

Proposition 2.2 Let M be an (n+1)-dimensional finite simplicial complex and let
ω : EW(M,n) → M be the standard resolution for f : M[n] → K(G,n), n ≥ 2.
Then for ω∗ : Hn(EW(M,n)) → Hn(M), ker ω∗ is a factor group of the direct sum
⊕G of finitely many G.

Proof. Inside each (n+1)-simplex of M cut a small closed ball around the barycenter
and not touching the boundary and split M into two subspaces M = M₁∪M₂ where
M₁= the closure of the complement to the union of the balls and M₂=the union
of the balls. Then ω is 1-to-1 over M₁, Hn−1(M₁ ∩ M₂) = 0, Hn(M₂) = 0 and
the preimage under ω of each ball is homotopy equivalent to K(G,n) and hence
Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂)) is the direct sum ⊕G of finitely many G. Consider the Mayer-Vietoris
sequences for the pairs (M₁, M₂) and (ω⁻¹(M₁), ω⁻¹(M₂)), in which we identify M₁
and M₁ ∩ M₂ with ω⁻¹M₁ and ω⁻¹(M₁ ∩ M₂) respectively.

From the Mayer-Vietoris sequences it follows that j∗(Hn(ω⁻¹(M₁)⊕Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂))) =
Hn(ω⁻¹(M₁ ∪ M₂)) and j∗(0 ⊕ Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂))) ⊆ ker ω∗. Let us show that j∗(0 ⊕
Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂))) ⊇ ker ω∗. Let j∗(a+b) ∈ ker ω∗. Then in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence
for the pair (M₁, M₂), j∗(a⊕0) = 0 and therefore there is c ∈ Hn(M₁∩M₂) such that
i∗(c) = a+0. Then in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the pair (ω⁻¹(M₁), ω⁻¹(M₂)),
i∗(c) = a ⊕ d and j∗(a + d) = 0. Thus j∗(a + b) = j∗(0 + (b − d)) and therefore
j∗(0 ⊕ Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂))) = ker ω∗. Recall that Hn(ω⁻¹(M₂)) = ⊕G and the proposition
follows.

Proposition 2.3 Let M = M₁ ∪ M₂ be a CW-complex with subcomplexes M₁ and
M₂ such that M₁, M₂ and M₁ ∩ M₂ are (n - 1)-connected, n ≥ 2 . Then M is
(n - 1)-connected and
(i) Hn(M) is A-divisible if Hn(M₁) and Hn(M₂) are A-divisible;
(ii) Hn(M) is A-torsion if Hn(M₁) and Hn(M₂) are A-torsion.

Proof. The connectedness of M follows from van Kampen and Hurewicz's theo-
rems and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. (i) and (ii) follow from the Mayer-Vietoris
sequence and (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 2.1.

Let X be a compactum and let σ(G) be the Bockstein basis of a group G. By
Bockstein's theory dimg X ≤ n if and only if dimE X < n for every E ∈ σ(G).
Denote:
T(G) = {p ∈ P : Zp ∈ σ(G)} ;
T∞(G) = {p ∈ P : Zp∞ ∈ σ(G)} ;


[PAGE 5] 
D(G) = P if Q ∈ σ(G) and D(G) = P \ {p ∈ P : Z(p) ∈ σ(G)} otherwise ;
F(G) = D(G) \ (T(G) ∪ T∞(G)).

Note that T(G), T∞(G) and F(G) are disjoint and G is F(G)-torsion free.

Proposition 2.4 Let X be a compactum and let G be a group such that G/TorG ≠ 0
and dimg X ≤ n. Then dimE X ≤ n for every group E such that E is D(G)-divisible
and F(G)-torsion free.

Proof. The proof is based on Bockstein's theorem and inequalities.
If Zp ∈ σ(E) then TorpE is not divisible by p and hence E is not divisible by p.
Thus p ∈ P \ D(G) and therefore Z(p) ∈ σ(G) and dimzp X ≤ dimz(p) X ≤ n.
If Zp∞ ∈ σ(E) then p is not in F(G). Then either p ∈ P \ D(G) and dimzpx X ≤
dimz(p) X ≤ n or p ∈ D(G) \ F(G) and then either p ∈ T(G) and dimzpx X <
dimz X ≤ n or p ∈ T∞(G) and dimzp∞ X ≤ n.
If Z(p) ∈ σ(E) then E/TorE is not divisible by p and hence E is not divisible by
p. Thus p ∈ P \ D(G) and therefore dimz(p) X ≤ n.
If Q ∈ σ(E) then consider the following cases:
(i) D(G) = P. Then since G/TorG ≠ 0, Q ∈ σ(G) and therefore dimQ X ≤ n
(this is the only place where we use that G/TorG ≠ 0);
(ii) there is p ∈ P \ D(G). Then dimQ X ≤ dimz(p) X ≤ n.

[PAGE 5] Proof of Theorem 1.2
Represent X as the inverse limit X = lim(Ki, hi) of finite simplicial complexes Ki
with combinatorial bonding maps hi+1 : Ki+1 → Ki onto and the projections
pi : X → Ki such that for every simplex Δ of Ki, diam(pi⁻¹(Δ)) ≤ 1/i. Following
A. Dranishnikov [3] we construct by induction finite CW-complexes Li and maps
gi+1 : Li+1 → Li, αi : Li → Ki such that
(a) Li is (n+1)-dimensional and obtained from K[n] by replacing some (n+1)-
simplexes by (n + 1)-cells attached to the boundary of the replaced simplexes by a
map of degree ∈ S(F(G)). Then αi is a projection of Li taking the new cells to the
original ones such that αi is 1-to-1 over K[n]. We define a simplicial structure on
Li for which αi is a combinatorial map and refer to this simplicial structure while
constructing resolutions of Li. Note that for F(G) = ∅ we don't replace simplexes
of K[n+1] at all;
(b) the maps hi, gi and αi combinatorially commute. By this we mean that for
every simplex Δ of Ki, (αi ◦ gi+1)((hi+1 ◦ αi+1)⁻¹(Δ)) ⊆ Δ.
We will construct Li in such a way that Z = lim(Li, gi) will be of dimg ≤ n and
Z will admit a G-acyclic map onto X.

[PAGE 5] Proof of Theorem 1.2 (continued)
For every simplex Δ of Ki of dim > n + 1 we first consider Step 1 of the construc-
tion. Let Δ be an (n + 1)-dimensional simplex of K₁. By ω₁|... we will denote
the map ωL|(αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δ) : (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δ) → αi⁻¹(Δ) with the range restricted
to αi⁻¹(Δ). Note that by (a), Hn(αi⁻¹(Δ)) is F(G)-torsion and Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) =
Hn((αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δ))/TorF(G)Hn((αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δ)). Let (ωL|...)* : Hn((αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δ)) →
Hn(αi⁻¹(Δ)). Consider the following cases.

Case 1-1. E = Zp. By Proposition 2.2 ker(ωL|...)* is p-torsion. Then since p is
not in F(G), by Proposition 2.1, (v), Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is p-torsion and by Bockstein's
theorem dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤ dimzp X ≤ n.

Case 1-2. E = Zp∞. By Proposition 2.2 ker(ωL|...)* is p-torsion and p-divisible.
Then since p is not in F(G), by Proposition 2.1, (vi), Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is p-torsion and
p-divisible and by Bockstein's theorem dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤ dimzp∞ X ≤ n.

Case 1-3. E = Z(p) or E = Q. By Proposition 2.2 ker(ωL|...)* is D(G)-divisible.
Then since F(G) ⊆ D(G), by Proposition 2.1, (iv), Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is D(G)-divisible
and since Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is F(G)-torsion free, by Proposition 2.4, dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤ n.

Now let us pass to Step 2 of the construction. We will show that the properties
of the homology groups established above will be preserved for simplexes of higher
dimensions. Let Δ be a (j + 1)-dimensional simplex of Ki, j > n + 1 and recall that
Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) = Hn(ωL⁻¹(∂Δ))/TorF(G)Hn(ωL⁻¹(∂Δ)). Note that from the construc-
tion it follows that the preimage under ωL of an (n - 1)-connected subcomplex of Ki
is (n - 1)-connected. Also note that the intersection of a j-dimensional simplex of Δ
with the union of any collection of j-dimensional simplexes of Δ is (n-1)-connected.
These facts allow us to apply below Proposition 2.3 for assembling ωL⁻¹(∂Δ) from
ωL⁻¹(Δ') for j-dimensional simplexes Δ' of Δ to show that ωL⁻¹(∂Δ) has properties
corresponding to properties of ωL⁻¹(Δ'). Once again we consider separately the
following cases.

Case 2-1. E = Zp. If for every j-dimensional simplex Δ' of Δ, Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ')) is
p-torsion then by Proposition 2.3, Hn(ωL⁻¹(∂Δ)) is p-torsion and hence Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ))
is p-torsion. Therefore dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤ dimzp X ≤ n.

Case 2-2. E = Zp∞. If for every j-dimensional simplex Δ' of Δ, Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ'))
is p-torsion and p-divisible then by Proposition 2.3, Hn(ωL⁻¹(∂Δ)) is p-torsion and p-
divisible and hence Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is p-torsion and p-divisible. Therefore dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤
dimzp∞ X ≤ n.

Case 2-3. E = Z(p) or E = Q. If for every j-dimensional simplex Δ' of
Δ, Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ')) is D(G)-divisible then by Proposition 2.3, Hn(ωL⁻¹(∂Δ)) is D(G)-
divisible. Then Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) is D(G)-divisible and F(G)-torsion free and by Propo-
sition 2.4, dimHn(ωL⁻¹(Δ)) X ≤ n.

Thus we have shown that EW(K₁, n) is suitable for X. Now replacing Ki+1 by
a Kl with a sufficiently large l we may assume that there is a combinatorial lifting
of hi+1 to hi+1 : Ki+1 → EW(Ki, n). Replace hi+1 by its cellular approximation
preserving the property of hi+1 of being a combinatorial lifting of hi+1.


[PAGE 8] Proof of Theorem 1.2 (continued)
Consider the (n + 1)-skeleton of Ki+1 and let Δi+1 be an (n + 1)-dimensional
simplex in Ki+1. Let Δi be the smallest simplex in Ki containing hi+1(Δi+1). Then
hi+1(Δi+1) ⊆ ωL⁻¹(Δi). Let τ : (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi) → ωL⁻¹(Δi) be the inclusion.
Note that from the construction it follows that for τ* : Hn((αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi)) →
Hn(ωL⁻¹(Δi)), ker τ* is F(G)-torsion. Recall that the n-skeleton of ωL⁻¹(Δi) is con-
tained in (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi) and consider hi+1|∂Δi+1 as a map to (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi). Let a be
the generator of Hn(∂Δi+1). Since hi+1|∂Δi+1 extends over Δi+1 as a map to ωL⁻¹(Δi)
we have that τ((hi+1|∂Δi+1)∗(a)) = 0. Hence (hi+1|∂Δi+1)∗(a) ∈ ker τ, and therefore
there is k ∈ S(F(G)) such that k((hi+1|∂Δi+1)∗(a)) = 0. Replace Δi+1 by a cell C
attached to the boundary of Δi+1 by a map of degree k if (hi+1|∂Δi+1)∗(a) ≠ 0 and set
C = Δi+1 if (hi+1|∂Δi+1)∗(a) = 0. Then hi+1|∂Δi+1 can be extended over C as a map
to (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi) and we will denote this extension by gi+1|C : C → (αi ◦ ωL)⁻¹(Δi).
Thus replacing if needed (n+1)-simplexes of Ki+1[n+1] we construct from Ki+1[n+1] a CW-
complex Li+1 and a map gi+1 : Li+1 → EW(Li,n) which extends hi+1 restricted to
the n-skeleton of Ki+1. Now define gi+1 = ωL ◦ gi+1 : Li+1 → Li and finally define
a simplicial structure on Li+1 for which αi+1 is a combinatorial map. It is easy to
check that the properties (a) and (b) are satisfied. Since the triangulation of Li+1
can be replaced by any of its barycentric subdivisions we may also assume that

(c) diam gi,j(Δ) ≤ 1/i for every simplex Δ in Li+1 and j ≤ i

where gi,j = gj+1 ◦ gj+2 ◦ ... ◦ gi : Li → Lj.

Denote Z = lim(Li, gi) and let ri : Z → Li be the projections. For constructing
Li+1 we used an arbitrary map f : Li[n] → K(E,n), E ∈ σ(G). Let us show that
choosing E ∈ σ(G) and f in an appropriate way for each i we can achieve that
dimE Z < n for every E ∈ σ(G) and hence dimg Z ≤ n.

Let ψ : F → K(E,n) be a map of a closed subset F of Lj. Then by
(c) for a sufficiently large i > j the map ψ ◦ gi,j|(gi,j)⁻¹(F) extends over a subcom-
plex N of Li to a map ϕ : N → K(E,n). Extending ϕ over Li[n] we may
assume that Li[n] ⊆ N and replacing ϕ by its cellular approximation we assume
that ϕ is cellular. Now define the map f : Li[n] → K(E,n) that we use for
constructing Li+1 as f = ϕ|Li[n]. Since gi+1 factors through EW(Li, n), the map
f ◦ gi+1|gi+1⁻¹(Li[n]) : gi+1⁻¹(Li[n]) → K(E, n) extends to a map f' : Li+1 → K(E,n).
Define ψ' : Li+1 → K(E,n) by ψ'(x) = (ϕ ◦ gi+1)(x) if x ∈ gi+1⁻¹(N) and ψ'(x) =
f'(x) otherwise. Then ψ ◦ gi+1|(gi+1)⁻¹(F) : (gi+1)⁻¹(F) → K(E,n) is homotopic to
ϕ ◦ gi+1|(gi+1)⁻¹(F) : (gi+1)⁻¹(F) → K(E, n) and hence ψ ◦ gi+1|(gi+1)⁻¹(F) extends


[PAGE 9] Proof of Theorem 1.2 (continued)
over Li+1. Now since we need to solve only countably many extension problems for
every Lj with respect to K(E,n) for every E ∈ σ(G) we can choose for each i a
map f : Li[n] → K(E, n) in the way described above to achieve that dimE Z < n
for every E ∈ σ(G) and hence dimg Z ≤ n.

The property (b) implies that for every x ∈ X and z ∈ Z,
(d1) gi+1(αi+1⁻¹(st(pi+1(x)))) ⊆ αi⁻¹(st(pi(x))) and
(d2) hi+1(st((αi+1 ◦ ri+1)(z))) ⊆ st((αi ◦ ri)(z))
where st(a) = the union of all the simplexes containing a.

Define a map r : Z → X by r(z) = ∩{pi⁻¹(st((αi ◦ ri)(z))) : i = 1, 2, ...}. Then
(d1) and (d2) imply that r is indeed well-defined and continuous.
The properties (d1) and (d2) also imply that for every x ∈ X
r⁻¹(x) = lim(αi⁻¹(st(pi(x))), gi|αi⁻¹(st(pi(x)))), where the map gi|αi⁻¹(st(pi(x))) is consid-
ered as a map to αi-1⁻¹(st(pi-1(x))).

Since r⁻¹(x) is not empty for every x ∈ X, r is a map onto and let us show that
r⁻¹(x) is G-acyclic.
Since st(pi(x)) is contractible, T = αi⁻¹(st(pi(x))) is (n - 1)-connected. From (a)
and Proposition 2.3 it follows that Hn(T) is F(G)-torsion. Then, since G is F(G)-
torsion free, by the universal-coefficient theorem Hn(T;G) = Hom(Hn(T), G) = 0.
Thus Hk(r⁻¹(x); G) = 0 for k ≤ n and since dimg Z ≤ n, Hk(r⁻¹(x); G) = 0 for
k ≥ n + 1. Hence r is G-acyclic and this completes the proof.
