**ABSTRACT**

Individual cells have numerous competencies in physiological and metabolic spaces. However, multicellular collectives can reliably navigate anatomical morphospace towards much larger, reliable endpoints. Understanding the robustness and control properties of this process is critical for evolutionary developmental biology, bioengineering, and regenerative medicine. One mechanism that has been proposed for enabling individual cells to coordinate toward specific morphological outcomes is the sharing of stress (where stress is a physiological parameter that reflects the current amount of error in the context of a homeostatic loop). Here, we construct and analyze a multiscale agent-based model of morphogenesis in which we quantitatively examine the impact of stress sharing on the ability to reach target morphology. We found that stress sharing improves the morphogenetic efficiency of multicellular collectives; populations with stress sharing reached anatomical targets faster. Moreover, stress sharing influenced the future fate of distant cells in the multi-cellular collective, enhancing cells' movement and their radius of influence, consistent with the hypothesis that stress sharing works to increase cohesiveness of collectives. During development, anatomical goal states could not be inferred from observation of stress states, revealing the limitations of knowledge of goals by an extern observer outside the system itself. Taken together, our analyses support an important role for stress sharing in natural and engineered systems that seek robust large-scale behaviors to emerge from the activity of their competent components.

**1. Introduction** (Page 1)

Morphogenesis, broadly considered, is the ability of groups of cells to build complex, functional anatomical structures. Large-scale manifestations of this process occur during embryonic development, regeneration, and metamorphosis; smaller-scale, but equally important, is the ongoing maintenance of order that can resist aging, degradation, and cancer over decades [1-4]. It's a remarkable process in which large numbers of cells cooperate to reliably build, and remodel toward an invariant target morphology.

A key aspect of morphogenesis is that it is not an open-loop (purely feed-forward) process [5]. It is often assumed that the conceptual tools of emergence and complexity science can capture this process: local rules executed recursively in parallel across all cells, will result in the generation of complex growth and form. This is certainly true; indeed there are now many computational models of complex patterns emerging from simple processes [6-10]. However, there is an additional and crucial component of biological morphogenesis which is missed by purely emergent models: anatomical homeostasis (or more accurately, homeodynamics), in which the system can pursue multiple different paths in order to achieve the same anatomical outcome despite novel circumstances. In effect, biological morphogenesis is not well-described by bottom-up, open-loop, mechanical models [11-13], but instead exhibits more complex policies as it navigates the space of possible anatomical shapes despite various perturbations [14]. This includes the ability to reach the correct target morphology despite damage (e.g., bisection of early embryos), scrambling of tissue positions, changes of cell size and number, as well as numerous alterations of the genome (reviewed in Refs. [5,14-17]). Numerous kinds of biochemical, biomechanical, and bioelectric prepatterns have been described which can encode setpoints for anatomical homeostasis [18-23].

Understanding how bodies navigate anatomical morphospace, including the nature and limits of reliability, the possible failure modes, and the optimal intervention strategies is crucial for advances in evolutionary developmental biology, the bioengineering of synthetic life forms, the biomedicine of birth defects and regenerative therapeutics, and adaptive robotics [24,25]. This specifically requires models of how the behaviors of individual cells scale up to adaptive responses at the level of the entire body. What mechanisms allow the coordination of cell activity toward one consistent morphology? In particular, any theory has to provide a hypothesis for how the homeostatic capabilities of individual cells relate to the much more complex homeostatic setpoint of the collective.

One candidate mechanism that has been proposed is stress – a concept with a rich history in physics and materials engineering and a good candidate for a generic principle of biological organization at the system level [26-29]. Stress is a popular topic in biology, studied at the level of DNA damage and protein misfolding, tissue morphomechanics, immunomodulation, behavior, and even whole ecosystems [27,30-37]. We have previously proposed [38] that the generic concept of stress – as a biophysical marker of the computed error (distance between the current state and a homeostatic setpoint) can be extended to the morphogenetic process. For example, the limb of the salamander will re-grow when amputated; the most remarkable part of this process is that it knows when to stop: growth and remodeling ceases when a correct salamander limb is completed [39,40]. Similarly, when a tail is transplanted to a limb-specific location in amphibia, it slowly remodels into a limb – the structure more appropriate to the bodyplan [41,42]. This, and other examples such as craniofacial corrections of scrambled amphibian faces [43-45], can be modeled as a progressive error minimization: cells continue to move and adjust until the error is within tolerance. The impetus that maintains activity could be seen as a stress reduction drive, as occurs at every other level of biological organization. Thus, in our models, stress reflects the degree of error – the distance (in this case, in anatomical morphospace) that the system can detect with respect to its prepattern. It is clear that many biological systems can detect and correct anatomical error (see examples in Refs. [5,17]); here, we focus not on these mechanisms but on the dynamics of the mediator of error information: stress.

While the molecular mechanisms of stress sensing, and the degree of conservation of specific molecules as bearers of the systemic stress signal from subcellular to multicellular scales, are currently under study and largely unknown, one interesting hypothesis concerns the role of stress sharing as a mechanism for the functional cooperation of cells in vivo. Consider a cell in the wrong position of a developing tissue and its positional information gradient (cell "I", in Fig. 1A). The cell is motivated to move, to relieve its stress; however, its neighbors are at their correct positions and their low stress causes strong functional inertia not to move away from their current low-energy configuration. The individual cell-scale homeostatic loops prevent cooperation in this case and the optimal anatomical configuration is not reached (Fig. 1.A1).

However, one simple way to resolve this problem would be to allow stress sharing molecules to leak out of the source cell and diffuse outward to neighboring cells. If all cells interpret these conserved, shared molecular signals as stress, a given cell cannot tell if its high stress sensation is due to a problem it has or a problem its neighbors have. A cell that is leaking stress raises the exploratory activity level – temperature – of the nearby cells [46] (a quantity known as temperature, in the physics of annealing systems), making them more plastic and willing to perform active behaviors because they do not rate their current state as a satisfactory, low-energy stable state. This lowers the barrier for them to undergo exploratory motion in the space, allowing the other cell to move through to lower its stress level, at which point the whole tissue is at the optimal lowest-energy configuration and every cells' stress is reduced (Fig. 1A2). This kind of scheme is common in computational models of biological networks [47-49], and produces cooperation without explicit mechanisms of altruism. By sharing stress with neighbors, one cell's (or region's) problem becomes everyone's problem, leading to a higher willingness to adopt new configurations in which everyone's free energy is lower (and thus, more optimal morphogenetic problem-solving).

**(Page 4)**

This hypothesis makes some strong predictions about the robustness of morphogenesis with and without such a stress sharing mechanism. However, in multiscale systems with emergent behaviors it is often not obvious how well such a mechanism would work, or what the resulting dynamics would be, without quantitative simulation. Here, we test those predictions in an in silico model of morphogenesis. In our model, migrating cells working to implement homeostatic target morphologies were either allowed or disallowed from sharing their stress during the process of rearranging in space.

We analyzed this model in three conditions, with the first being designed to test the impact of stress sharing and the last two being null hypothesis controls. First, our experimental mode with stress sharing, in which the individual cellular homeostats, in which stress is proportional to distance from their homeostatic setpoint, do propagate their stress to other cells. By analyzing these results, we find interesting phenomena that suggest that stress sharing is an easy way to achieve robustness in collectives made up of homeostatic subunits.

Second, a mode in which cells are agents and possess certain competencies that modify the resulting phenotypic fitness - they still have homeostatic loops governed by stress but they do not export it to their neighbors [50,51].

Third, a "direct development" mode in which phenotypes are hard-wired from the genotype, mirroring many uses of genetic algorithms and numerous theoretical biology or artificial life studies which omit the developmental layer between them (no homeostatic competency or regulative development). By comparing the data, we find interesting and important roles of stress sharing as a dynamic that facilitates collective problem-solving.

**2. Methods** (Page 4)

We modeled (see Supplements S1 and S2 for technical approach and code execution details) embryos achieving a target morphology in-silico; the target morphology we chose was similar to the "electric face" bioelectric prepattern known to exist during frog embryogenesis [52]. We assessed the impact of embryogenesis on the morphogenetic process by encoding embryos with different developmental routines and comparing their reorganization potential. All developmental routines involved varying degrees of stress sharing between cellular components as encoded by their genome. Apart from comparing developmental routines on an individual scale, we also sought to compare its effects on an evolutionary scale by wrapping the developmental process within an evolutionary algorithm.

In our framework, an embryo was treated as a collection of cells within a two-dimensional (2D) grid. We chose a two-dimensional (2D) matrix data structure to be its computational equivalent for modelling, referring to its elements as cells (analogous to biological cells). Thus, our biological tissue is simplified as a discretized lattice, conceptually related to Chua's cellular neural networks [53]. Embryos were grouped into three different kinds based on their cells' ability to reorganize themselves during development: (1) stress-sharing embryo: wherein cells moved by sharing their stress, (2) without-stress-sharing embryo: where cells could move, but could not share their stress levels with others, and (3) hardwired: where cells could not move at all. The first two types thus included a developmental layer between genotype and phenotype, while the third simulated an organism with no regulative development, where the connections between genotype and phenotype was much more direct [51].

Our primary goal was to observe how the presence of a developmental process, - which acted as a layer separating the initial substrate of the embryo from its reorganized state - altered the evolutionary dynamics of a population. To quantify this, we evolved populations of embryos using a genetic algorithm (GA). Since our genetic algorithm had to account for a developmental stage during the life cycle of an embryo, it was an iterative sequence of the following stages: 1. Development, 2. Selection, and 3. Mutation (Fig. 2).

**(Page 5)**

During initialization, each embryo (i.e., each 2D matrix) was initialized with one of two cell types (0 or 1) and were patterned in a stochastic manner to give a scrambled appearance to their structure (Fig. 2A.I). Each embryo within a population was initialized similarly with a unique scrambled pattern and the specific pattern itself was treated as its genome. In addition, the genome also encoded a separate value (the reorganization gene marker) which indicated the type of developmental reorganization it could undergo during the upcoming developmental stage.

**2.1. Stress-based development** (Page 5)

Post initialization, a population of embryos underwent development (the first stage of the genetic algorithm). During development, embryos reorganized their cells to resemble a target two-dimensional pattern which we pre-specified in our experiments to be binary image of a smiling face (Fig. 2A.II). Based on the kind of reorganization gene marker encoded in its genome, an embryo could either undergo reorganization by sharing its stress, by not sharing its stress, or by not using stress at all.

Stress was a binary signal which indicated whether a particular cell was in its correct x, y coordinate position (with respect to the target) or not. Since our initial embryo was scrambled, most of its cells were bound to be stressed. Stressed cells were inherently driven to move somewhere (they possessed a sense of restlessness), the question of where to move to was based on another signal which we called the distress signal.

A distress signal originated in those cells which were not stressed (we called these "fixed cells"). Each of these fixed cells had a tendency to observe their neighbors (a 3x3 neighborhood around them) and to check if there were any stressed cells present. On recognizing the presence of a stressed cell in a particular direction within their 3x3 neighborhood, they would send a radially diminishing signal (which had a strength of 1.0 at its origin, but radially diminished in strength) encoding the presence and the location of a stressed cell. This process was analogous to how cells at a wounded site send signals elsewhere requesting assistance. In our case, a fixed cell, requested assistance in a particular location by sending a distress signal.

It is important to note that not all cells received this distress signal. First, only stressed cells received it, and second, only those stressed cells carrying a cell-value of the opposite kind received it: As an example, suppose a fixed cell (say, F1) identifies a stressed cell (say, S1) of cell-type "0" located on top of it; the stressed cell, S1, is precisely stressed because it is of the wrong cell type at the wrong x, y location). Thus, the fixed cell, F1 recognizes this and sends a distress signal to the rest of the 2D grid, requesting some other distant stressed cell (say S2) with the opposite cell-type "1" to move to the place of S1, thereby relieving its stress.

The above example is a simplification; in practice, multiple distress signals were sent out simultaneously, and stressed cells could receive and accumulate these signals to move to a specific target location. Once distress signals were captured by stressed cells, they moved.

Movement occurred sequentially. At each instance, a single stressed cell in the grid was chosen at random, and its distress-signal-record from various sources was consulted. Its destination for movement was chosen as that location from which the distress signal was strongest in value. The chosen stressed cell moved to its target by repeatedly swapping with intermediate elements in the direction of shortest path.

**(Page 6)**

**2.2. Types of cell-movement (cellular competency) and the concept of stress-sharing** (Page 6)

During cell movement, we had to deal with a problem: what would happen to the fixed elements which were in the way of a stressed cell as it moved towards its destination? If the stressed element swapped with fixed cells, it would dislodge them causing them to become stressed (thereby increasing the overall stress rather than decreasing it). We solved this problem by disallowing stressed elements to swap with intermediate fixed elements i.e., by default, if a stressed element encountered a fixed element while making its way towards its chosen destination, it could not move any further and would get stuck.

A special case which over-rode this default, was when we pre-specified stressed cells to share their stress with its neighbors. Since stress was a binary signal (0 or 1), a stressed cell communicated its status as a stressed cell to a fixed neighbor during movement. This communication process was termed "stress-sharing" and the effect it had was a coercion of the fixed cell to create a passage (a de facto tunnel) for movement through it rather than by swapping with it (Fig. 1B). Thus, on receiving a shared signal of stress from a stressed cell moving towards its destination, the fixed cell created a temporary channel, which allowed the stressed cell to swap with other stressed cells through it. In case multiple fixed cells stood in the way of the moving stressed cell, stress sharing ensured a tunnel was created through all of them for movement. The tunnel induced as a result of the shared stress was temporary. Once the stressed cell moved away from the tunneled fixed cell, it reverted back to its original "blocking state". Such a stress sharing mechanism, allowed the possibility of free, unrestricted movement towards all parts of the discrete grid, preventing dislocation of fixed cells from their grid positions during cell-movement. An alternate form of the reorganization process, one which did not involve stress sharing was also considered. In such cases, a stressed cell would get stuck as soon as it encountered a fixed cell while moving towards its destination in the direction of shortest path.

To summarize, an embryo could undergo one of three different kinds of reorganization: 1. With stress sharing, 2. Without stress sharing, and 3. Hardwired. Since the first two methods involved local cell movement they were termed competent strategies. The hardwired case served as a control to the other two competent strategies. The cells of a hardwired embryo could not move and thus lacked a reorganization process; development during evolution only served as a placeholder, without any functional significance.

Post-development, embryos possessed a transformed structure and the resulting grid organization was termed its Phenotype. Thus, the developmental stage served as an independent layer separating the genotype from the phenotype. Definitions of the genotype and the phenotype, as they have been used here, have loose connections with biology and assume special meaning only here. Demarcating these two phases allowed us to monitor the impact of the reorganization process on fitness throughout evolution (Fig. 2).

**(Page 6)**

**2.3. Fitness function** (Page 6)

Our genetic algorithm served as a search process over genotypes which best reorganized themselves according to the target pattern (a smiling face in our experiments). The fitness value of any embryo was determined by its l2 distance, *d* with the target.

*d* = (1/N^2) * ΣΣ(Eij - Tij)^2

Where Eij and Tij are the (i,j)th elements of the embryo and the target respectively. Intuitively, the fitness function provided a quantitative metric of how close the embryo was to the target morphogenetic pattern. During evolution, we noticed significant differences between populations in higher fitness values than lower fitness values. To make this apparent, we zoomed into higher fitness values by exponentiating the l2 distance as follows:

*d* = e^(d/9)

Given the presence of a developmental step, two separate configurations of the embryo existed during a single cycle of the GA: 1. The state of the embryo prior to development (as the genotype) and 2. The state of the embryo post development (as the phenotype). Consequently, two kinds of fitness existed: the genotypic fitness, which measured the fitness of the genotype; and the phenotypic fitness, which measured the fitness of the phenotype. An exception occurred in hardwired embryos: since they lacked competency, their phenotype was equivalent to their genotype and thus their phenotypic fitness was equivalent to its genotypic fitness.

**2.4. Kinds of embryos** (Page 6)

The genotype of each embryo carried a "reorganization-marker" indicating the kind of developmental reorganization it could undergo during development. Each embryo was categorized into three different kinds based on this gene marker as follows: 1. With stress sharing embryo. 2. Without stress sharing embryo, and 3. Hardwired embryo. The first two categories had a general ability for reorganization, and were termed as "competent", in the sense of problem-solving ability of active tissues to restore correct shapes despite induced barriers, perturbations, and other interventions [5,54]. Alternatively, the hardwired embryo was not-competent and possessed a fixed structure throughout development.

**2.5. Populations for evolution** (Page 6)

Our genetic algorithm evolved populations of embryos of three different kinds: 1. Stress sharing population, 2. Without stress-sharing population, and 3. Hardwired population. To create a population of size M; M 2D-matrices of size N were initialized by randomly scrambling the target pattern (also of size N). We initialized grids this way in order to maintain the same number of cell types (0's and 1's) across both the initialized embryo and the target. It ensured simplicity and allowed us to focus on reorganization rather than "growing" the required kind of cell types to satisfy the target pattern.

**2.6. Genetic algorithm** (Page 6)

We evolved each population by passing it iteratively through a sequential process of: 1. Development, 2. Selection, and 3. Mutation. During the selection stage, phenotypic fitnesses were used to select the best genotypes for the subsequent generation (Darwinian selection). In order to repopulate the population with variant genotypes we mutated the selected genotypes by stochastically moving a few cells to random locations. At the end of each generation, we plot the phenotypic fitness and the genotypic fitness of the embryo with the highest phenotypic fitness in the population (see Supplement S2 for more details).

**2.7. Competency value and cell-Distance** (Page 6)

Embryos with competency (either with stress sharing or without stress sharing) were given a pre-determined "competency value". This value provided an upper bound to the number of swaps the cells of the embryo could execute during the developmental step. We also monitored the total distance travelled by these cells by calculating the average Euclidean-distance moved by elements during a generation.

**(Page 7)**

**2.8. Statistical analyses** (Page 7)

To observe the impact of stress sharing during evolution, we plot the fitness curves of each population (with stress sharing, without stress sharing, and hardwired), over 1000 generations. 95% confidence intervals (CI) over 10 runs of each experiment were plotted to verify if any of the CI bands of any population overlapped with each other across 1000 generations. A lack of overlap suggested a significant difference in evolutionary dynamics. Further, we measured the statistical difference between different populations at arbitrary points during evolution and carried out a t-test between samples of any two populations to quantify their similarity.

**3. Results** (Page 7)

**3.1. Stress sharing helps populations solve the problem of morphogenesis faster** (Page 7)

To determine whether a cellular rearrangement process involving stress sharing helps in discovering the optimal morphogenetic process faster, we compared the evolution of three different populations in-silico, each with a different kind of cellular rearrangement process over 1000 generations.

The experiment consisted of running a population of embryos through a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm (GA) involved an iterative process of development, selection, and mutation. The developmental step was introduced to allow a genotype to change into a phenotype before selection (Fig. 2). Three different populations were evolved through our GA: 1. a population which relied on stress sharing to rearrange itself; 2. a population which relied on stress but had no sharing capacity, 3. a population which had no rearrangement capability (hardwired). We plot the phenotypic fitness (Fig. 3A.I) and the genotypic fitness (Fig. 3A.II) of the embryo with the highest phenotypic fitness in each of these populations over 1000 generations averaged over 10 runs to observe their morphogenetic ability.

We observed that populations with stress-sharing were able to discover the correct genotype and the competency necessary to form the target pattern faster than the other two populations (Fig. 3A). Members of this population discovered how to arrive at the target pattern by generation 500, at which a population with sharing had a significantly different phenotypic fitness from either the hardwired (p<0.01), or that of the population without sharing (p<0.01). Further, the confidence intervals of these curves did not overlap, indicating their distinct separation from one another (Fig. 3A.I).

The way in which stress sharing populations derived their advantage was by progressively improving their genotype during the early stages of evolution (Fig. 3A.II), behaving as if they were a hardwired population (we found no statistical difference between the two until generation ~400 (p = 0.9). In contrast, populations without stress sharing improved their genomes only fractionally above their initialized states (Fig. 3A.II) and relied exclusively on their competency to achieve high phenotypic fitness towards the target (Fig. 3A.I). Such a strategy paid off early during evolution (until generation ~400) but resulted in diminishing gains post this point (Fig. 3A.I).

We verified the phenotypes of the best embryo in each of these populations at generation 0, 250, 750, and 1000. We observed that at generation 250, all three populations had a similarly distorted pattern as confirmed by their approximately similar fitness values (Fig. 3B). Further, the stress-sharing and the without stress-sharing populations had a similar fitness value (=0.88) at this point (Fig. 3A.I, p = 0.97), even though the population without-sharing engaged in a different dynamic compared to the other two populations (Fig. 3). At generation 750, despite their similar dynamics early on during evolution, the embryos with stress sharing were capable of forming the target pattern, whereas the hardwired population could not; however, we noted that it does perform better than the population without-stress sharing. At generation 1000, we observed the hardwired embryos being closer to maximum fitness with a positive slope of 0.19 compared to the population without sharing (slope = 0.05).

We conclude that populations with stress sharing discover the correct morphological solution faster than hardwired populations or populations without stress sharing. Hardwired populations, relying on mutations alone, are eventually capable of achieving high fitness, while populations without-sharing are worse than hardwired populations over long time scales.

**(Page 7)**

**3.2. Stress sharing helps populations with a range of complexity solve morphogenesis** (Page 7)

In our first experiment, each embryo within a population was a matrix of size 30x30. To determine how sharing benefits populations of cells of different sizes, we initialized multiple instances of the previous experiment each with a different grid size and compared their fitness curves over 1000 generations. Specifically, we ran three instances of the previous experiment, with grid sizes 20x20, 30x30, and 50x50. Within each instance, we compared the performance of the stress-sharing population with the hardwired and without-sharing populations by observing their fitness curves (Fig. 4).

We observed that for a grid size of 20x20 (Fig. 4A), stress-sharing populations were able to reach maximum phenotypic fitness by generation 100; hardwired populations were able to reach maximum phenotypic fitness at generation 1000 and a population without sharing was unable to reach phenotypic maximum fitness even after 1000 generations of evolution (Fig. 4A.I). The genomes of the stress-sharing and hardwired populations evolved identically during the early stages of evolution (until generation 100 throughout which we noticed no statistical difference (p = 0.96) post which the stress-sharing population stabilized. (Fig. 4A.II). Genomes of the without-stress-sharing population improved marginally above its initialized state.

At a grid size of 30x30, a similar pattern of evolutionary behavior emerged: the stress-sharing population reached maximum phenotypic fitness faster, followed by hardwired with a rising slope (=0.19) at generation 1000, and the without sharing population with a stable phenotypic fitness around ~0.91 at generation 1000 (Fig. 4B.I). Genomes exhibited identical patterns as well: the stress-sharing and hardwired populations had similar early stage dynamics (until generation 400) (p = 0.96), post which the stress-sharing population's genome stagnated. The without-sharing population's genome improved by less than 20% above its initialized state (Fig. 4B.II). Further, we observed that these dynamics were all right-shifted versions (with respect to time) of the experiment with grid size 20x20. Generally, populations of size 30x30 took a longer time to reach the same phenotypic fitness level as in 20x20, and genomes of the stress-sharing population stabilized after a longer time (~300 generations longer).

At a grid size of 50x50, 1000 generations were insufficient for any of the three populations to reach maximum phenotypic fitness (Fig. 4C.I). However, general patterns similar to those seen at lower grid sizes were observed: phenotypic fitness of the stress-sharing population evolved similarly to the hardwired population until generation 400 (p = 0.96), followed by a short term decrease, before rising back up to hardwired levels. The without-sharing population exhibited early gains but stabilized closer to generation 1000 (Fig. 4C.I). Trends in genotypic fitness revealed a similar dynamic to those seen in lower grid sizes (20x20, and 30x30): the hardwired and stress-sharing population evolved similarly, however, unlike lower grid sizes, its dynamics dropped momentarily before reaching hardwired levels. The without-stress sharing population exhibited relatively modest improvement of its genome, but we note that it is higher than either of the previous two grid sizes.

We conclude that as grid size increases, the problem of morphogenesis grows harder, with populations requiring a longer time to reach peak fitness. Despite the increase in complexity, a stress-sharing population can utilize its competency to reach maximum fitness. The benefit of stress-sharing is especially noticed in the later stages of evolution when mutations cannot be relied upon to solve the problem efficiently, and more precise cell movements are required.

**(Page 9)**

**3.3. Stress sharing encourages cell-movement over long distances** (Page 9)

How does stress sharing help the collective achieve its morphogenetic objective? We next tested the hypothesis that the sharing of stress information facilitates the movement of cells over longer distances. To quantify its effect to fitness improvement, we plotted the competency value and the average Euclidean distance travelled by cells of the best embryo in each of the three populations throughout evolution.

Specifically, we initialized populations with members of size 30x30 and ran them through our GA for 1000 generations. In each generation, we picked the embryo whose phenotypic fitness was the highest and traced its genotypic fitness (Fig. 5A.II), competency value (Fig. 5A.III), and the average Euclidean distance travelled by its cells within that generation (Fig. 5A.IV). Each embryo was given a maximum possible competency value of 4725 which was determined as a function of its grid size, N (see Supplement S3)

We observed that the stress-sharing population utilized maximum competency (=4725) until ~ generation 400, beyond which its value dropped to ~4500 and remained approximately stable thereafter. The population without stress-sharing utilized a competency of ~100 throughout evolution and the hardwired population used 0 competency because it wasn't allowed to use competency by design (Fig. 5A.III).

Further, the cells of the best embryo (i.e., with the highest phenotypic fitness) in the stress-sharing population moved an average Euclidean distance of ~2500 units until ~ generation 400, post which it varied around a value of ~2400 units. In case of the population without stress-sharing - owing to its lower usage of competency – cells moved an average of ~200 units throughout evolution (Fig. 5A.IV).

We conclude from these observations that stress-sharing is beneficial precisely because it enables cells to move over longer distances through a stress-communication mechanism (Fig. 5A). Owing to the approximate nature of such movement, stress-sharing embryos are capable of utilizing a high degree of competency (Fig. 5A.III) to solve the morphogenetic puzzle. In contrast, a population without stress-sharing lacks such a communication mechanism and is therefore restricted to local cell-movements. Movement restriction enforces a limit on competency causing embryos to perform poorly. The Hardwired population leverages mutations to solve the morphogenetic task better than a competent population with no stress sharing.

**(Page 9)**

**3.4. Stress sharing increases cells' radius of influence** (Page 9)

We then sought to study these dynamics from the perspective of the cognitive light cone model [55], which focuses on the radius in space and time of events that any given agent can use as a homeostatic setpoint. In effect, taking the agent's perspective in terms of what it functionally "cares about" [56-59].

As a cell moves towards its target position during development, it disturbs other cells, knocking them out of position and altering their future fates towards a target position. To quantify the range over which a given cell alters the fate of another cell, we plot the maximum radius over which a cell dislodges another cell at each stage of development. Specifically, we took a single embryo of each kind (with sharing and without sharing), passed it through the developmental stage, and plot the maximum radius over which cells dislodged other cells in each developmental step (Fig. 5 B).

We observed that in an embryo with stress-sharing, a cell influenced another cell located a radius of 30 units on average at developmental step-1. This distance progressively decreased over development, with the value dropping to zero at step 85 (Fig. 5B.I). In contrast, in an embryo without sharing, a cell altered the fate of another cell located at a radius of only 5 units on average at development step 1, with development ceasing completely by step 10. (Fig. 5B.I).

An alternative view of the radius of influence over developmental time is shown in Fig. 5 B.II, and 5.B.III, which better illustrates the impact of stress-sharing over developmental time. We plotted the radius of influence as a rectangular bar of proportionate size, and stacked multiple such blocks at developmental steps of 5, 20, 35, 65, 80, and 85 for the stress-sharing embryo (Fig. 5B.II), and at steps 1 and 10 for the without-stress sharing embryo. (Fig. 5B.III).

We conclude that stress sharing increases the cognitive light cone of an embryo compared to an embryo without stress sharing (Fig. 5B.I). As development proceeds, the radius of the cognitive light cone decreases, lasting longer for an embryo with stress sharing (Fig. 5B.II), but terminating prematurely in case of an embryo without sharing (Fig. 5B.III). Sequential morphogenesis causes stress to fluctuate over the course of development.

**(Page 11)**

Next, to observe the spatio-temporal time course of stress during development, we manually broke down the target pattern (smiling face) into a set of sequential targets and observed how stress varied as each target pattern was introduced. Specifically, we broke down the target pattern of the smiling face into a set of discrete components: left eye only > right eye only > eyes only > eyes and smile > complete face. We set each of these components as the target pattern starting from the "left-eye only" target and moving towards the "complete face" target. We introduced a new target only when development had optimized the source pattern to the current target pattern. We identified this point by observing the stress value: as long as it decreased, optimization was treated as in-progress.

We took a single embryo of each kind (stress-sharing & without stress-sharing), scrambled their elements randomly from the final target pattern (complete face), and then let them develop towards each sequential partial target pattern, and plotted the average stress within the embryo throughout development (Fig. 6).

We observed that in both kind of grids, stress fluctuated. On introducing a target pattern, stress momentarily increased and then continued to decrease until the current target pattern was attained to the best possible extent by the competency process of the grid. In a stress-sharing embryo, stress progressively decreased until the relevant target pattern was perfectly achieved (Fig. 6A), whereas in embryos without stress sharing, the target pattern was only partially formed due to the constrained cell-movement within its elements (Fig. 6B). Consequently, a stress-sharing embryo was capable of perfectly forming each sequential target pattern and stress was able to reach zero at step 40 (Fig. 6A). The without-sharing embryos however, was unable to form any of the sequential target patterns well. Tiny improvements of ~1% in fitness were noticed between each sequential pattern, but progress was limited to movement of less than 55 cells on average (compared to 4500 cells on average for the stress-sharing embryo) and development lasted for 10 steps only (Fig. 6B).

We conclude that sequentially introducing new features increases the average stress, but given enough competency and a communication mechanism (sharing), individual features can be formed perfectly with the corresponding feature's average stress reducing to zero. However, without a communication mechanism, no matter the competency value, cells are restricted in their movement and tend to get stuck in localized patches. Thus, a communication mechanism tied to their homeostatic loop (such as stress-sharing) is key if competency is to have an impact on reorganization capacity.
