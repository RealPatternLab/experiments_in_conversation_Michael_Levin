Abstract
Biased left-right asymmetry is a fascinating and medically important phenomenon. We provide molecular genetic and physiological characterization of a novel, conserved, early, biophysical event that is crucial for correct asymmetry: H<sup>+</sup> flux. A pharmacological screen implicated the H<sup>+</sup>-pump H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase in *Xenopus* asymmetry, where it acts upstream of early asymmetric markers. Immunohistochemistry revealed an actin-dependent asymmetry of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits during the first three cleavages. H<sup>+</sup>-flux across plasma membranes is also asymmetric at the four- and eight-cell stages, and this asymmetry requires H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity. Abolishing the asymmetry in H<sup>+</sup> flux, using a dominant-negative subunit of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase or an ectopic H<sup>+</sup> pump, randomized embryonic situs without causing any other defects. To understand the mechanism of action of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase, we isolated its two physiological functions, cytoplasmic pH and membrane voltage (V<sub>mem</sub>) regulation. Varying either pH or V<sub>mem</sub>, independently of direct manipulation of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase, caused disruptions of normal asymmetry, suggesting roles for both functions. V-ATPase inhibition also abolished the normal early localization of serotonin, functionally linking these two early asymmetry pathways. The involvement of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase in asymmetry is conserved to chick and zebrafish. Inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase induces heterotaxia in both species; in chick, H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity is upstream of *Shh*; in fish, it is upstream of Kupffer's vesicle and *Spaw* expression. Our data implicate H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity in patterning the LR axis of vertebrates and reveal mechanisms upstream and downstream of its activity. We propose a pH- and V<sub>mem</sub>-dependent model of the early physiology of LR patterning.

[PAGE 2] Introduction
Consistent left-right (LR) asymmetries in the vertebrate body plan are of fundamental significance to both basic biology and medicine (Burn, 1991; Kosaki and Casey, 1998; Levin, 1999; Levin et al., 1996). Although the genetic cascades of secreted signals that occur on only one side of the embryo are being elucidated (Burdine and Schier, 2000; Whitman and Mercola, 2001), upstream mechanisms remain poorly understood (Levin, 2005; Yost, 2001). Recent findings shed light on the events which function upstream of asymmetric transcription (Bunney et al., 2003; Fukumoto et al., 2005b; Kramer et al., 2002; Levin and Mercola, 1998; Levin and Mercola, 1999; Tanaka et al., 2005), and it is now known that ion flux is involved in determining the laterality of several vertebrates and invertebrates (Duboc et al., 2005; Hibino et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2002; McGrath et al., 2003; Raya et al., 2004; Shimeld and Levin, 2006). To gain molecular insight into endogenous ion flows that control asymmetry, we performed a loss-of-function drug screen (Adams and Levin, 2006), implicating the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (Levin et al., 2002). Here, we characterize another crucial component of early embryonic physiology: the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase.

The H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase complex (see Fig. S1A in the supplementary material) or V-ATPase (Nishi, 2002), is found in the membranes of vacuoles where it acidifies the intravesicular environment (Inoue et al., 2003; Kawasaki-Nishi et al., 2003; Nishi, 2002). In many cell types, the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is also present in the plasma membrane (Klein et al., 1997; Narbaitz et al., 1995; Nishi, 2002), where, by pumping protons out of the cell, it affects the pH of the cytoplasm and immediate extracellular environment (Brown and Breton, 2000; Kawasaki-Nishi et al., 2003; Scarborough, 2000). The H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is also strongly electrogenic (Harvey, 1992; Wieczorek, 1999).

Interestingly, besides the ‘housekeeping’ functions of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase and other electrogenic proteins, their activity has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation, migration and differentiation (Levin, 2003a; Nuccitelli, 2003). One important example of morphogenesis relying upon precisely orchestrated cell behavior is the generation of consistent left-right asymmetry (Cooke, 2004; Levin, 2005), and a number of biophysical mechanisms based on bioelectricity and fluid movement have been implicated (Hamada et al., 2002; Levin, 2003c; Tabin and Vogan, 2003). Moreover, the conservation of early LR mechanisms is highly controversial (Burdine and Schier, 2000; Essner et al., 2002; Levin, 2003c). Although ion flux is crucial in early frog and chick embryos (Levin, 2005), ciliary motion has been implicated in rodents (McGrath and Brueckner, 2003; McGrath et al., 2003) and zebrafish (Amack and Yost, 2004; Essner et al., 2005; Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005). To understand how ion fluxes participate in asymmetry, it is necessary to characterize the endogenous behavior of the relevant pumps in embryos and to place their function in the context of known LR patterning mechanisms. Here, we explore the properties of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase function in several vertebrate embryos. Through endogenous localization of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase and gain- and loss-of-function experiments in chick, frog and zebrafish, we identify the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase as a novel, conserved, obligate component of LR patterning upstream of asymmetric gene expression.


[PAGE 3] Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry
*Xenopus* embryos were collected according to standard protocols (Sive et al., 2000) in 0.1× Modified Marc’s Ringers (MMR) pH 7.8 + 0.1% Gentamicin. *Xenopus* embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967). Chick embryos from Charles River Laboratories, maintained at 38°C, were staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992). Zebrafish embryos (Westerfield, 1995) were maintained at 28.5°C in water containing 1 drop per gallon Methyl Blue.

[PAGE 3] Assaying organ situs
*Xenopus* embryos at stage 45 were analyzed for position (situs) of three organs: the heart, stomach and gallbladder (Levin and Mercola, 1998). Heterotaxia was defined as reversal in one or more organs (Fig. 1K,L). Only embryos with normal dorsoanterior development (DAI=5) and clear left- or right-sided organs were scored; percent heterotaxia was calculated as number heterotaxic divided by the number of scorable embryos, i.e. embryos normal in all other ways, with DAI=5. The proportion of unscorable embryos (number unscorable over total number of embryos), is reported as a measure of treatment toxicity, but has no influence on the heterotaxia score. The autofluorescence of gallbladder and pancreas was used to score situs in zebrafish embryos. A Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> (increased stringency) was used to compare absolute counts of heterotaxic embryos.

[PAGE 3] Pharmacological treatments
*Xenopus* embryos were incubated from 45 minutes post-fertilization to stage 6-7 in drugs (Fig. 1) at doses reported in Table 1. All of the reagents used were selected on the basis of high specificity for known electrogenic targets (Drose et al., 1993; Shen et al., 2003; Wheatly and Gao, 2004), and were titered to ensure that the DAI of the treated embryos was normal, thus avoiding confounding randomization caused by midline defects (Danos and Yost, 1996). Embryos were transferred to 0.1× MMR at stage 6-7 and scored at stage 45. For all data shown, normal midline development and DAI were observed. For cytoskeleton disruption experiments (Fig. 3), embryos were treated with 50 nM nocodazole or with 0.7 μM latrunculin, in 0.1 × MMR (Qiu et al., 2005).

To apply reagents to chick embryos with minimal disturbance, a small hole was made in each egg (prior to incubation), and 5 ml of light albumin removed. The experimental solution, consisting of pharmacological reagent (Table 1) in 5:1 light albumin and Pannett-Compton (Stern and Holland, 1993) was placed into the egg. Eggs were wrapped with Scotch tape, incubated at 37.5°C, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

*Danio rerio* embryos were incubated at 28.5°C in 1 μM lobatomide A16 or 250 nM concanamycin during stages indicated.

[PAGE 3] Self referencing ion selective probe measurements
For self referencing ion selective probe (SERIS) measurements of proton flux (Smith et al., 1999), healthy *Xenopus* embryos were cultured in 0.1× MMR at pH 7.0. H<sup>+</sup> flux measurements were made to the left and right, equidistant from the ventral midline, near the AV midline, slightly on the animal side, and approximately in the middle of the left-ventral quadrant and the right-ventral quadrant of the embryo. The displacement of the electrode was along a line that lay 45° from the normal to the surface of the embryo. This was true for both measuring positions. We calculate a correction factor of 10<sup>5</sup> for the presence of 0.5 mM HEPES buffer and have applied that factor to generate the absolute flux values reported in the Results section (Arif et al., 1995). The ratio of the fluxes across the ventral midline is unaffected by this correction. (Contact the authors for further details.)

[PAGE 3] Membrane voltage sensitive dye DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3)
Bis-(1,3-dibarbituric-acid)-trimethine-oxanol [DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3), Molecular Probes] accumulates in proportion to membrane voltage; the more depolarized a cell, the greater the accumulation and fluorescence intensity of DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3). Stock DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) (1 mg/ml in DMSO) was diluted 1:10 in distilled water, then 1:100 in 0.1× MMR (1.9 μM final). *Xenopus* embryos were soaked for 30 minutes, then imaged submerged in dye, using a Leica TCS SP2 Spectral Confocal Imaging System. The dye was excited at 488 nm and a 20 nm band of emission wavelengths centered at 515 was collected. On any given day, photomultiplier tube gain was kept constant to allow comparisons among images.

[PAGE 4] Expression analysis
Whole mount *in situ* hybridization (WISH) on *Xenopus* was performed using a standard protocol (Harland, 1991) using *XNr1* (Lohr et al., 1998; Lowe et al., 1996a), chick *Shh* (Levin et al., 1995) and chick *Nodal* (Levin et al., 1995) probes. WISH analysis was performed on zebrafish embryos as described (Albertson and Yelick, 2005). After staining, embryos were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and dehydrated in 100% methanol overnight to remove background staining. Images were manipulated with Adobe Photoshop to increase clarity; data were neither added nor removed.

Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (Levin, 2004). Briefly, *Xenopus* embryos were fixed overnight at 4°C in MEMFA; chick embryos were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Some embryos were embedded for 40 μm sectioning on a vibratome. Samples were blocked with 20% goat serum+0.2%BSA and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody: anti-subunit A, 1:500 (Kawa et al., 2000); anti-myosin V, 1:500 (Chemicon #AB5887), anti-RFX3, 1:500 (Bonnafe et al., 2004); anti-subunit F, 1:500 (Peng et al., 1996); anti-subunit c, 1:500 (against peptide DAGVRGTAQ, Invitrogen). After washing, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The chromogenic reaction was timed to optimize signal to noise ratio. Standard no-primary, no-secondary and peptide-adsorbed primary controls were used and resulted in no staining. Patterns reported for localization of V-ATPase subunits represent a consensus of data obtained from at least 15 embryos. Images were manipulated with Adobe Photoshop to increase clarity; data were neither added nor removed.

[PAGE 4] Microinjection of mRNAs
*Xenopus* embryos were injected with capped, synthetic mRNAs (Sive et al., 2000) into the animal hemisphere of one-cell embryos 45-90 minutes post-fertilization. NHE3 constructs were injected into the vegetal hemisphere within 60 minutes of fertilization. Zebrafish embryo microinjection was performed as described previously (Payne-Ferreira and Yelick, 2003). Results of injections are reported as: % of otherwise normal embryos that were heterotaxic; sample size (n); % of injected embryos that died or were abnormal after gastrulation and not scored; and χ<sup>2</sup> and *P* values comparing treated with controls.

[PAGE 4] Results
Inhibition of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase specifically causes heterotaxia
To identify molecular candidates for electrogenic proteins involved in LR patterning, we performed a pharmacological loss-of-function screen (Fig. 1A-J, Table 1) (Adams and Levin, 2006; Fukumoto et al., 2005a; Fukumoto et al., 2005b; Levin et al., 2002; Mitchison, 1994). A panel of inhibitors targeting a wide variety of transporters (Fig. 1B-J), like many others reported previously (Levin et al., 2002), induced a very low incidence of laterality phenotypes, ruling out the corresponding targets from important roles in asymmetry and demonstrating the general stability of LR patterning. By contrast, inhibitors of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase all induced strong heterotaxia (compare Fig. 1K with 1L) in the absence of changes in dorsoanterior character or general toxicity (Danos and Yost, 1995; Danos and Yost, 1996). For example, the potent and highly-specific V-ATPase blockers concanamycin (Huss et al., 2002) and bafilomycin (Bowman et al., 1988) induced heterotaxia in 35% (n=100) and 36% (n=100) of the embryos respectively. Importantly, inhibition of the other two major classes of H<sup>+</sup> transporters, carbonic anhydrase (Fig. 1B) and the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE, Fig. 1C), did not affect laterality. Specific and dose-dependent (Fig. 1M) randomization of LR asymmetry, induced by loss-of-function reagents targeting the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase, but not other H<sup>+</sup> pumps or a wide range of other ion transporters, implicate endogenous H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase in the LR pathway in *Xenopus*.

To test unequivocally the requirement for H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity using specific molecular reagents, we analyzed asymmetry in embryos injected with *YCHE78* mRNA, which encodes a well-characterized dominant negative H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunit E (Lu et al., 2002). Misexpression of this dominant-negative construct specifically induced 20% heterotaxia [(n=191), controls=4% (n=422), χ<sup>2</sup>=40.6, *P*<0.001]. By contrast, injection of mRNAs encoding the *Xenopus* H,K-ATPase α subunit (Mathews et al., 1995), or the dominant-negative *Kir2.2* subunit (Zobel et al., 2003) did not cause heterotaxia (1% heterotaxia each, n=85,93 respectively). These data are consistent with the screen results, demonstrate that embryonic asymmetry is not generally labile with respect to microinjection *per se* (even when performed during cytoplasmic rotation), and strongly support the hypothesis that H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase function is necessary for LR patterning.

[PAGE 5] H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase inhibitors disrupt localization of normally left-sided transcripts
To determine the relationship between H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase and the asymmetric gene cascade, we analyzed the expression of the earliest known asymmetric gene in *Xenopus*: *Nodal* (Hyatt et al., 1996). In embryos treated with the potent and specific heterotaxia-causing H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin (Table 1), the situs of the left-sided marker *XNr1* (Fig. 2A) was effectively randomized (Fig. 2B-D), exhibiting aberrant sidedness of expression in 54% of the embryos (Table 2). We conclude that H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase functions upstream of the asymmetric transcription of *Nodal* and feeds into the known asymmetric gene cascade.

[PAGE 5] H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits are asymmetrically localized in *Xenopus*
Because prior experiments and physiological data (below) indicated that the first cell cleavages are key to establishing ion flux-related asymmetries (Levin, 2003b; Levin et al., 2002), we focused our immunohistochemical analysis on the localization of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits during the first few hours of development in *Xenopus*. In early embryos, most proteins are symmetrically localized with respect to the LR axis (Fig. 3A,B). Immunohistochemistry revealed that at the two-cell stage, H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits (Fig. 3D) exhibited ‘fingers’ extending up from a pool in the vegetal cytoplasm into the animal half. Such patterns are specific to a number of LR-relevant proteins but are not a general feature of all protein localization in the early frog embryo (Qiu et al., 2005) (Fig. 3A,B). In sections perpendicular to the AV axis at the two-cell stage, one cell was often more heavily stained (>80% of the embryos examined, Fig. 3E) (see Fig. S1I-K in the supplementary material), exhibiting both a cytoplasmic pool and localization at the cell cortex. At the four-cell stage, staining was still asymmetrical, and was on the right side in embryos that could be oriented by the cleavage furrows and pigmentation (Fig. 3F, see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). Consistent with the proposed role of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase in LR asymmetry, these electrogenic protein subunits are novel markers of LR asymmetry as early as the first two cleavages in *Xenopus*.

To probe upstream mechanisms (Qiu et al., 2005; Yost, 1991), we asked whether the asymmetric localization of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase required organized microtubules/microfilaments. Treatment of one-cell embryos with the actin depolymerizer latrunculin (Ayscough, 1998) caused apparently random localization of subunit A (Fig. 3G). By contrast, treatment with the microtubule disrupting agent nocodazole (De Brabander et al., 1986) had no obvious effect on the LR distribution of subunit A (Fig. 3H). Embryos treated with low levels of these specific cytoskeletal disruptors develop normally to later stages, but, consistent with these data, displayed randomized asymmetry (Qiu et al., 2005).

[PAGE 6] Early *Xenopus* embryos drive H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase-dependent, asymmetric H<sup>+</sup> flux
In light of the loss-of-function and localization data, we asked whether the activity of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase (H<sup>+</sup> flux) might provide a consistently asymmetric physiological signal to the L and R sides of the body. Using a SERIS probe (Hotary et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1999; Smith and Trimarchi, 2001), we detected a large net efflux of protons from the cleavage furrow of the two-cell stage. This efflux averaged 12.7±22 pmole cm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (n=5) at about the midpoint of cleavage. Importantly, we also found evidence for asymmetry of H<sup>+</sup>-flux. As early as the four-cell stage, a distinct difference in proton efflux was detected across the ventral midline, with larger efflux occurring on the right side, consistent with the immunological localization of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits on one side (Fig. 3F, see Fig. S1F,G,K in the supplementary material). In measurements on 15 embryos made between the four-cell stage and stage 6, the average proton efflux from the middle of the right ventral quadrant was 4.1±0.48 pmole cm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and from the left ventral quadrant was 1.9±0.29 pmole cm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. The average ratio of the efflux from the right side to efflux from the left side was 2.3±0.3.

To confirm that the asymmetric efflux was due to asymmetric H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase function, we compared H<sup>+</sup> efflux in control embryos with embryos treated with ion flux inhibitors. Neither the absolute net proton fluxes nor their right/left ratios were affected by the application of omeprazole (0.27 μM), an inhibitor of H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. However, the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin (0.28 μM) reduced the proton efflux on the right side to about half of its original value and eliminated the LR asymmetry in the proton fluxes [ratio went from 2.1±0.2 to 1.1±0.05 (n=3), t=4.85, *P*<0.05]. Taken together, these data reveal the existence of consistent H<sup>+</sup> flux asymmetry in the four-cell embryo, and confirm that, as suggested by the localization data, the asymmetry in the flow of H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the early blastomeres is due specifically to differential H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity.

Because in many systems the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase contributes significantly to the membrane voltage gradient V<sub>mem</sub> (Gluck, 1992), we also used the reporting dye DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) to determine whether there is a consistent asymmetry to V<sub>mem</sub> (Epps et al., 1994). Embryos marked with Alexa 647 dextran in the right ventral cell (RV) at the four-cell stage were monitored using DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) at 4-32 cells (Fig. 4). Although no pattern was obvious in 4-, 8- or 32-cell embryos, at 16 cells, we observed hyperpolarization of the RV quadrant, relative to the LV quadrant (Fig. 4A, yellow shading). An example of an embryo in which this difference is easily observed is shown in Fig. 4B-D. This pattern and its embryological timing are consistent with the SERIS data, and with the hypothesis that higher net H<sup>+</sup> efflux on the right side at the four-cell stage results in a difference in membrane potential across the ventral midline by the 16-cell stage.

That this V<sub>mem</sub> gradient is detectable in 16-cell embryos implies that H<sup>+</sup>-flux-affecting reagents must be active by this stage in order to affect LR patterning. To test this prediction, we injected *YCHE78* mRNA, the dominant-negative H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunit E, into the LV or RV cell at the four-cell stage, which results in no detectable expression until the ~64-cell stage. This had no effect on organ situs [controls=0% (n=38, unscorable=4%), LV=0% (n=62, unscorable=10%), RV=1% (n=67, unscorable=12%)], χ<sup>2</sup>=0.0, *P*=0.9), although co-injected GFP was expressed normally (DNS). Similarly, we injected *YCHE78* DNA at the one-cell stage, which leads to protein expression only after zygotic transcription begins at mid-blastula transition. Co-injected β-gal DNA was expressed (and caused higher toxicity than mRNA injections), but injections had no effect on organ situs [β-gal DNA alone=0% (n=38, unscorable=65%), *YCHE78* DNA=3% (n=29, unscorable=70%), χ<sup>2</sup>=2.0, *P*=0.155]. These data are consistent with a dependence of LR asymmetry on very early, but not later, activity of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase.

[PAGE 7] Exogenous plasma-membrane H<sup>+</sup>-pump activity causes heterotaxia
We next examined the effects of an excess, symmetrical H<sup>+</sup>-flux across the plasma membrane on both sides of the midline. We induced ectopic H<sup>+</sup> flux by expressing a well-characterized single-subunit plasma-membrane H<sup>+</sup>-pump, *PMA1.2* (Masuda and Montero-Lomeli, 2000). Use of this construct also allowed us to address whether it is the balance of H<sup>+</sup> flux at the cell membrane that is important for LR asymmetry, as the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is also known to occur in vacuoles, while *PMA1.2* functions only in the cell membrane. Ubiquitous early misexpression of this H<sup>+</sup> pump at cell surfaces caused significant heterotaxia [*PMA1.2*=21% heterotaxic (n=135, unscorable=22%), untreated=2% (n=187, unscorable=3%), χ<sup>2</sup>=28.3, *P*<0.001]. These data are consistent with the SERIS probe measurements and the importance of differential H<sup>+</sup> flux, and suggest that it is the flow of hydrogen ions across the cell, not vacuole, membrane that is important for LR asymmetry.

[PAGE 7] Manipulation of pH causes heterotaxia
To gain insight into the mechanisms by which the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase controls downstream events, we separately tested its two physiological roles – regulation of pH and membrane voltage - by experimentally altering these two parameters independently of direct manipulations of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase. We first examined the effect of changing the pH of the external environment of the embryo by raising or lowering the pH of the medium during cleavage stages (Table 3). Although pH 7-11 had no effect on asymmetry, pH 5-6 caused a low level of LR patterning defects (6%, *P*=0.003), and pH 4 caused a significant level of heterotaxia (19%, *P*<0.001). This is consistent with inhibition of the activity of H<sup>+</sup>-extruding pumps by high external proton concentrations. To alter embryonic pH without changing V<sub>mem</sub>, we used the electroneutral OH<sup>−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> exchanger tributyltin chloride (TBT, Table 1) to raise internal pH (Matsuya et al., 2000; Simchowitz et al., 1991). Treatment with 10 μM TBT from stages 1 to 13 caused heterotaxia in 17% of embryos [(n=151); untreated 1% (n=361); χ<sup>2</sup>=44.7, *P*<0.001].

To study the effect of isolated changes in pH using greater molecular specificity, we overexpressed the electroneutral, plasma-membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger *NHE3* (Praetorius et al., 2000; Sabirov et al., 1999). Injection of this antiporter mRNA within 1 hour of fertilization caused heterotaxia [*NHE3*=16% (n=77, unscorable=32%), untreated=3% (n=114, unscorable=5%), χ<sup>2</sup>=8.9, *P*=0.003]. This confirms the importance of pH for LR asymmetry, and, similar to the *PMA1.2* data, indicates that the relevant H<sup>+</sup> flux occurs at the cell membrane, not in vesicles. Interestingly, *NHE3* was active in causing heterotaxia only when injected in the vegetal hemisphere and when injected within 60 minutes of fertilization; later injections had no effect. Assuming that *NHE3* mRNA is translated ~1.5 hours after injection (based on detection of β-gal/GFP translation), the temporal window during which *NHE3* can cause heterotaxia ends by 2.0 to 2.5 hours post-fertilization at 18°C. Consistent with expression data, the asymmetric membrane voltages at 16-cell stage, and the lack of effect on asymmetry of late *YCHE78* injection or DNA injection, we conclude that the LR-relevant gradients in cell membrane H<sup>+</sup> flux occur during the first cleavages, and that normal asymmetric pH at the cell membrane is crucial for LR patterning.

[PAGE 7] Manipulation of V<sub>mem</sub> causes heterotaxia
The H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is electrogenic (Gluck, 1992; Harvey and Wieczorek, 1997) and can therefore significantly contribute to the steady-state V<sub>mem</sub>. We confirmed this in *Xenopus* blastomeres by imaging V<sub>mem</sub> *in vivo* in control and concanamycin-treated embryos. As predicted, inhibition of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase depolarizes V<sub>mem</sub> (Fig. 4E,F). We conclude that H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity is necessary for the normal pattern of V<sub>mem</sub> in *Xenopus*.

To address the role of V<sub>mem</sub> in the absence of pH changes, we altered V<sub>mem</sub> directly by incubating embryos in the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> inhibitor palytoxin (PTX), which converts the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase into a nonspecific ion channel, thus dissipating the voltage gradient and depolarizing cells (Hilgemann, 2003; Tosteson et al., 1997; Tosteson et al., 2003). PTX treatment (2 nM) of embryos from stage 1-6 caused heterotaxia in the absence of DAI change or other defects in 20% of surviving treated embryos [(n=60, unscorable=84%), untreated=2% (n=58, unscorable=3%), χ<sup>2</sup>=8.3, *P*=0.004]. We conclude that normal V<sub>mem</sub>, or patterned differences in V<sub>mem</sub>, are necessary for normal asymmetry.

[PAGE 8] H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is present in early chick and zebrafish embryos
To explore the evolutionary conservation of an H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase-dependent LR-patterning mechanism, we characterized the expression pattern of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase subunits in chick and zebrafish. *In situ* hybridization analysis of subunits A, c, and F (Fig. 5A-D), and immunocytochemistry for subunits F and c (Fig. 5E-H) indicated that the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is expressed in the primitive streak of chick embryos at stages 2-4, and in the node at stage 4 – the time-period in which chick LR sidedness is determined by depolarization in the streak (Levin et al., 2002). Zebrafish embryos (Fig. 7A-F) showed immunohistochemical staining for subunit c in two- to eight-cell stage embryos. By the 32-cell stage, staining appeared stronger in the marginal cells. Early in epiboly, staining was even in all cells, and subunit c was detected surrounding some yolk syncytial nuclei. Staining was apparent in all cells at epiboly.

First, to confirm that H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is upstream of LR patterning events in chick, we examined the effect of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase inhibition on the expression of the early left-sided marker, and correlate of heart looping, *sonic hedgehog* (Levin et al., 1995). Inhibition of H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase by concanamycin (Woo et al., 1996) or DCCD (Finbow et al., 1993) specifically randomized the localization of *Shh* and *Nodal* (Fig. 6A-D). Concanamycin induced aberrant sidedness of *Shh* expression in 67%, and *Nodal* in 24%, of embryos (Table 4). Thus, as in *Xenopus*, H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase is upstream of the known asymmetric gene cascade, and is required for normal *Nodal* expression and therefore normal LR patterning in chick.

Next, we assayed whether the pattern of cellular pH in the early chick blastoderm requires H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase activity. Using the pH reporting dye SNARF-1-AM (Buckler and Vaughan-Jones, 1990; Morley et al., 1996), we found that in control embryos, area pellucida cells maintain higher intracellular pH than primitive streak cells (Fig. 6G,H). And, as predicted
