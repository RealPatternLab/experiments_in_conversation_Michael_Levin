Abstract
Several ion transporters have been implicated in left-right (LR) patterning. Here, we characterize a new component of the early bioelectrical circuit: the potassium channel KCNQ1 and its accessory subunit KCNE1. Having cloned the native Xenopus versions of both genes, we show that both are asymmetrically localized as maternal proteins during the first few cleavages of frog embryo development in a process dependent on microtubule and actin organization. Molecular loss-of-function using dominant negative constructs demonstrates that both gene products are required for normal LR asymmetry. We propose a model whereby these channels provide an exit path for K+ ions brought in by the H+,K+-ATPase. This physiological module thus allows the obligate but electroneutral H+,K+-ATPase to generate an asymmetric voltage gradient on the left and right sides. Our data reveal a new, bioelectrical component of the mechanisms patterning a large-scale axis in vertebrate embryogenesis.

[PAGE 1] Introduction
Bioelectric controls of embryonic patterning
Most modern work on developmental biology focuses on biochemical signals that control morphogenesis. However, a large body of research indicates that physical parameters, such as ion fluxes and endogenous voltage gradients, control crucial aspects of cell behavior [1-3]. Roles for bioelectric signals have been uncovered in galvanotaxis of migratory cell types including neural crest, wound healing, limb development, and mitotic control (reviewed in [4-6]). One context in which ion transporter activity couples to large-scale pattern formation is in left-right (LR) patterning.

Vertebrates, and many invertebrates, possess a bodyplan that is basically bilaterally symmetrical, with the striking exception of the consistent placement of the heart and viscera, as well as lateralization of the brain [7, 8]. The embryonic generation of asymmetry is now understood to involve conserved independent left- and right-sided cascades of asymmetric gene expression feeding into the asymmetric morphogenesis of individual organs [9, 10]. Recent work revealed that in several species, physiological asymmetries in voltage, pH, and intracellular small molecule movement control LR patterning at the very earliest stages of development (upstream of asymmetric gene expression) [11-13].

[PAGE 2] Ion transporters' roles in left-right asymmetry
Seeking to identify the transporters responsible for the asymmetry-relevant ion flows, Levin et al. performed a screen in Xenopus [14] which implicated three transporters: the H+/K+-ATPase exchanger [13], the V-ATPase H⁺ pump [15], and a K+ inward rectifier [16]. Using loss- and gain-of-function (by misexpression of mRNAs encoding wild-type and dominant-negative constructs), characterization of embryonic and subcellular localization of native maternal proteins, and physiological measurements of ion flux and transmembrane voltage, several of these transporters were functionally validated as obligate components of LR patterning long before ciliogenesis.

The three implicated transporters are present as maternal proteins in the egg. During the first few cleavages (which establish the prospective midline axis [17, 18]), they are transported to one side of the midline [19], accumulating in one of the cells. This consistently asymmetric localization gives rise to a directly measurable oriented asymmetry in H+ efflux and membrane voltage difference between the ventral blastomeres. When these physiological asymmetries are experimentally equalized, asymmetric gene expression and situs of the heart, gut, and gall-bladder are randomized in the absence of other defects (including those of dorso-anterior development).

Quantitative models are currently being built which attempt to synthesize the phenomena beginning with asymmetric localization of channels and pumps within early cells, leading to asymmetric voltage gradients, affecting in turn movement of small molecule morphogens through gap junction paths [20, 21], and ultimately leading to stabilization of asymmetric gene expression. However, one major piece remains unknown.

By itself, the H+,K+-ATPase (which is the best-understood component of this system) is electroneutral, exchanging two positive charges in each cycle [22]. Thus, it is entirely unclear how the asymmetric activity of this pump results in the measured membrane voltage difference across the ventral midline. However, the initial screen also implicated the KCNQ1 K+ channel, which could in principle support the exit of the K+ ions brought in by the H+,K+-ATPase, thus allowing a net loss of positive ions. Such a scheme could allow the two transporters, when working together, to alter membrane voltage levels. Interestingly, precisely this cooperative functional relationship is known to exist between the H,K-ATPase and KCNQ1 in several mammalian tissues [23-29].

[PAGE 2] KCNQ1 and KCNE1 channels
KCNQ1 (also known as KvLQT1) is a 6-transmembrane member of the K+ channel family (Fig. 5). When co-assembled with KCNE1 (a.k.a. minK, IsK), it forms the "slow delayed rectifier" or Iks channel [30]. Coexpression of KCNE1 alters the biophysical channel features of KCNQ1 by shifting the voltage dependence, slowing activation kinetics, abolishing inactivation, and increasing the single-channel conductance and the current amplitude [31]. KCNQ1 has different pharmacological profiles depending on whether it is associated with KCNE1 [32, 33].

KCNQ1 has a number of important biological roles, being responsible for an inherited birth defect that leads to cardiac arrhythmia - the so-called long-QT syndrome [28, 32, 34-38], and for the hearing loss observed in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndromes [39, 40]. The KCNQ1 channel is also required for gastric acid secretion, where it works together with the H+/K+-ATPase [26, 28, 29]. It is thought that the KCNQ1 plays a crucial role in luminal K+ recycling during the acid secretion necessary for normal digestion [27]. It appears that the 

[PAGE 3] KCNE1 subunits do not play a role in modulation of the pH gradient produced by H+/K+-ATPase activity because the KCNE1 knockout mouse has normal acid secretion [29].

Thus, in order to fully understand the bioelectrical circuit responsible for physiological LR asymmetries, we focused on embryonic functions of KCNQ1 in the Xenopus embryo. Our expression and functional analysis reveals an endogenous role for this protein in left-right patterning.

[PAGE 3] Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry
Xenopus embryos were collected according to standard protocols [41] in 0.1X Modified Marc's Ringers (MMR) pH 7.8 + 0.1% Gentamicin. Xenopus embryos were staged according to [42].

Chromogenic in situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed as previously described [43]. Xenopus embryos were collected and fixed in MEMFA. Prior to in situ hybridization, embryos were washed in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 and then transferred to methanol through a 25%/50%/75% series. Probes for in situ hybridization were generated in vitro from linearized templates using DIG labeling mix from Invitrogen. Chromogenic reaction times were optimized for signal: background ratio. Marker analyses were done on 70-80 embryos for each marker.

Xenopus Microinjection
For microinjections, capped, synthetic mRNAs [41] were dissolved in water and injected into embryos in 3% Ficoll using standard methods (50-150 msec pulses in each injected cell with borosilicate glass needles calibrated for a bubble pressure of 50-70 kPa in water). Injections delivered approximately 2.7 nL into each cell. After 30 minutes embryos were washed in 0.75X MMR for 30 minutes and cultured in 0.1X MMR until desired stages. Results of injections are reported as: % of otherwise normal embryos that were heterotaxic, sample size (N), and x² and p values comparing treated to controls (using Pearson correction).

Immunohistochemistry
Embryos were fixed overnight in MEMFA and stored at 4 °C in PBTr (1X PBS + 0.1% Triton-100). They were embedded in gelatin/albumin medium, and sectioned at 40 μ on a Leica vibratome as previously described [44]. The sections were then washed 3X in PBTr, blocked with 10% goat serum, and incubated with primary antibody at 1:500 in PBTr overnight, washed 6X with PBTr, and incubated with an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody overnight. After 6 washes in PBTr, detection was carried out using NBT and BCIP (X-Phos). Chromogenic reaction times were optimized for signal: noise ratio. Antibodies used were: a polyclonal antibody to IsK [45] used at 1:1000, and two KCNQ1 antibodies generated by Invitrogen to peptide sequences TYEQLNVPRMTQDNIS and ITHISELKEHHRAAIK (used at 1:500). Consensus patterns are reported for each plane of section and embryonic stage based on N>20.

Drug exposure
KCNQ blockers (obtained from Sigma and Tocris) were made as 1000X aliquots in DMSO, and used as: Chromanol293B - 300 μΜ [46, 47], Clofilium tosylate - 100 μΜ [48], L-768673 – 90 μΜ [49], Linopiridine – 5 mM [50], RL-3 – 10 μΜ [51].

[PAGE 4] Cytoskeleton modulating compounds (Molecular Probes): the microtubule disruptor Nocodazole [52, 53] and the microfilament disruptor Latrunculin [54, 55] were used at 50 nM and 4 µM respectively.

Laterality assay
Xenopus embryos at st. 45 were analyzed for position (situs) of 3 organs: the heart, stomach, and gallbladder [56]. Heterotaxia was defined as reversal in one or more organs. Only embryos with normal dorsoanterior development (DAI=5) were scored, thus avoiding confounding randomization caused by midline defects [57], and clear left- or right-sided organs were scored; percent heterotaxia was calculated as number heterotaxic divided by the number of total scorable embryos, i.e. embryos normal in all other ways, with DAI=5. A x² test (with Pearson correction for increased stringency) was used to compare absolute counts of heterotaxic embryos.

Western blotting
Twenty-five Xenopus embryos at the 4-cell stage were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X100, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 7.6, 2 mM PMSF). Protein solution was mixed at 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer (Biorad) containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. After washing, the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% dry milk in tris-buffered saline including 0.1% Tween-20. It was then incubated overnight in a Mini-PROTEAN II multiscreen apparatus (Biorad) at 4 °C with the primary antibody, diluted in TTBS + 3% BSA + 5% dry milk. After washing, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:5000) and developed using an ImmunoStar Chemiluminescent Protein Detection System (Biorad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

[PAGE 4] Cloning and plasmid construction of Xenopus laevis KCNQ1 and KCNE1
Xenopus laevis full length xKCNQ1 cDNA was isolated from Yamamoto/Hyodo-Miura NIBB/NBRP Xenopus DMZ library-derived ESTs, utilizing the known partial sequence (Genbank accession #U71076, [58]) against the EST database XDB (http://Xenopus.nibb.ac.jp). Candidate EST clone XL240i21ex was fully sequenced, and by open reading frame prediction, and by also multiple sequence alignment analysis using Clustal W software, was seen to contain the complete coding region of xKCNQ1 (Genbank accession #EF078696). The plasmid clone was named pCS2p+xKCNQ1. In order to remove the 3'-UTR region from pCS2p+xKCNQ1, primers xKCNQ1-ORF-Up [5'-AGA TAT ATT GTC CTG AGT CAT CCT CGG CAC-3'] and pCS2p+Stop+XhoI-Down [5′-TGA CTC GAG CCT CTA GAT TCT GCA GCC CTA-3'] were used in PCR mutagenesis by KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen, Madison, WI), constructing pCS2p+xKCNQ1_ORF. A constitutively-active (CA) mutation based on homologous human mutation (hKCNQ1_S140G, [59]) was introduced into pCS2p+xKCNQ1_ORF by KOD Hot Start PCR mutagenesis using primers xQ1_S130G mut-down [5′-GAG TAC TTT CTA CAA TAC AGC AGT ATA ACA-3′] and xQ1_S130G mut-up [5′-CGA AGA TCA GAC ATA TCA ACA CGA TGA GGA-3'], constructing pxQ1_S130G(CA). In a similar manner, a homologous dominant-negative (DN) mutation (hKCNQ1_V254M, [34, 60, 61]) was introduced using primers xQ1_V244M down [5′-TGG TTT TTA TTC ATA GAC AAG AAC TGA TCA-3'] and xQ1_V244M mut-up [5′-TGG ATC CGA GTA ATC TCC ATG TGC CGC CCT G-3'], constructing pxQ1_v244M(DN). Similarly, homologous ER-retained dominant-negative (ER-DN) mutations (hKCNQ1_ Y111C & _L114P, [62]) were introduced using primers xQ1_Y101C down [5′-CAA CTT CTT AGA GCG GCC CAC CGG CTG GAA-3'] and xQ1_Y101C mut-up [5′-CAA ACT CTG CCC TGG ATG TTG GTC CGG CTG-3'] to construct pxQ1_Y101C (ER-DN), and primers xQ1_L104P mut-

[PAGE 5] down [5′-CAG AGC GGC CCA CCG GCT GGA AAT GCT TCG-3'] and xQ1_L104P mut-up [5'-GGA AGT TGT AAA CTC TGC CCT GGA TGT TGG-3'] to construct pxQ1_L104P (ER-DN). Double-DN mutants pxQ1_Y101C+V244M and pxQ1_L104P+V244M were constructed in parallel, using pxQ1_v244M(DN) as template.

Full length xKCNE1 cDNA was cloned from stage 25 embryo cDNA by PCR using primers xKCNE1-Down5' [5'-GGG AAT TCG TAG AAG GAG TCC AAG ATA GAG AAG AA-3'] and xKCNE1-Up3′ [5'-AGC TCG AGT CAG TTG CTG GGA GAA GAG GGG ATA TA-3'], designed from existing Xenopus laevis full length clone (Genbank accession #AF545500, [63]), and was subcloned into pCS2p+ vector's EcoRI-Xhol site, constructing pCS2p+xKCNE1. A homologous dominant-negative (DN) mutation (hKCNE1_G52R, [64]) was introduced using primers xE1_G46R down [5′-GAT TCT TCG GCT TTT TTA CTT TTG GGA TAA-3'] and xE1_G46R mut-up [5'-GCA GCA GTA GAA GGA TAT ACA CCA CTT CCA-3'], constructing pxE1_G46R(DN). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

ẞ-gal staining
Embryos were fixed with MEMFA for 15 minutes at 4 °C and processed for ẞ-gal staining using standard methods [41] using X-gal or Red-gal substrate.

[PAGE 5] Results
XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 are implicated by a loss-of-function drug screen
A comprehensive hierarchical inverse drug screen was performed as previously described [14]. This strategy seeks to identify specific ion transporters functioning in laterality determination by successive application of increasingly-specific blocker compounds to embryos between fertilization and st. 8 (prior to gastrulation). The assay was specific reversals of one or more of the heart, gut, or gall bladder (heterotaxia) in the absence of other defects, generalized toxicity, or changes in dorsoanterior index [57, 65, 66]. This technique was previously used to identify roles in asymmetry for the serotonin pathway [12, 67] and for two specific H⁺ and K+ exchangers [11].

The results are summarized in Fig. 1A. As we previously reported [13, 15], most drug inhibitors targeting ion transporters had no effect on LR asymmetry. In particular, a variety of H+ channels, Ca++ channels, voltage-gated Na+ channels, Na+/H+ exchangers, and Ca++-activated K+ channels were revealed as very low-priority targets and not pursued further. Similarly, embryos treated with vehicle only exhibited the normal 1% background of heterotaxia. These data represent the negative controls; a positive control was the H+/K+-ATPase, which we characterized in previous work and which, when inhibited, resulted in ~50% randomization of the embryos.

Exposure of frog embryos (Table 1) from fertilization to st. 8 to barium chloride resulted in a significant degree of randomization (68%, p<<0.01) suggesting involvement of some kind of potassium conductance. A second round of the screen using more specific K+ channel inhibitors revealed that exposure to the KCNQ blockers Chromanol293B [46, 47], Clofilium tosylate [48], L-768673 [49], and Linopiridine [50] induce significant rates of heterotaxia (Fig. 1A, columns marked with asterisk). Although the pharmacology by itself cannot prove a functional role, these data suggest KCNQ1 (Fig. 1B,C) as a possible channel involved in early embryonic asymmetry. Thus, we pursued the functional roles of this channel in early embryogenesis by generating mutations in native frog KCNQ1 and KCNE1 matching a series of characterized mutants recovered from human patients with long QT syndrome.

[PAGE 6] Cloning of native frog KCNQ1 and KCNE1
KCNQ1 is an ancient potassium channel, and has been described in Drosophila [68, 69] and C. elegans [70]. Full-length clones for XKCNQ1 (EF078696) and XKCNE1 (AF545500) were recovered from Xenopus laevis cDNA libraries as described in Materials and Methods. These α and β subunits exhibited 62%/78% and 54%/42% homology to the human sequence at the nucleotide/amino acid level respectively.

[PAGE 6] XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 are required for normal LR asymmetry: molecular validation
We tested the hypothesis that XKCNQ1 and/or XKCNE1 are required for normal LR asymmetry by examining laterality in embryos expressing mutated subunits that are known to function in a dominant negative manner (by assembling with wild-type subunits and down-regulating endogenous complex function). Embryos at the 1-cell stage were injected with synthetic mRNA encoding dominant-negative XKCNQ1 proteins (Fig. 1D) that had been identified in human cardiac patients and characterized physiologically in Xenopus oocyte systems, allowed to develop to organogenesis stages, and then were analyzed for the positions of the heart, gut, and gall-bladder. Uninjected embryos, or embryos injected with β-gal or dominant negative Kir2.1 mRNA (negative control) only exhibited the low background level of heterotaxia (<4%). We generated a mutant of the native Xenopus sequence, with a valine 244 to methionine change in the cytosolic loop connecting the S4 and S5 transmembrane domain, matching the human dominant negative mutant V244M [61, 71]. This construct, as well as the ER-retention dominant negative mutant L104P [62], and the double mutant L104P+V244M, all caused significant levels of heterotaxia (p<<0.01, Table 2A). We conclude that the activity of XKCNQ1 is necessary for normal LR patterning (although our data do not rule out involvement of other K+ channels). Overexpression of wild-type XKCNQ1 or of the S130G constitutively-active mutation of XKCNQ1 [59, 72] did not induce heterotaxia (2%, N=969), suggesting that XKCNQ1 is already activated under basal conditions during LR patterning.

Because adding the ER mutation to the V244M mutant increases the incidence of phenotype (a synergistic, additive effect), it is likely that the ER mutation does function as a dominant negative as previously described [62], and is not due to a cryptic gain-of-function effect of increased ion transport in the endoplasmic reticulum. The dominant negative mutant of XKCNE1, G46R (a mutation in the transmembrane domain that reduces the channel complex's current to about half of its normal value [64]), also caused significant levels of heterotaxia (p<<0.01, Table 2A). Thus, it is likely that XKCNE1 is required for LR patterning, and that the dominant negative construct acts by impairing endogenous XKCNQ1-XKCNE1 complex function.

We next examined the consequences of overexpression of the XKCNE1 accessory subunit (Table 2B). Microinjection of native Xenopus KCNE1 mRNA at the 1-cell stage (which distributes the protein throughout the embryo) resulted in 18% heterotaxia (p<<0.01). In light of the heterotaxia induced by both over- and under-expression of exogenous XKCNE1 mRNA throughout the embryo, we conclude that correct LR patterning requires a specific level and/or spatial distribution of native XKCNE1. In contrast, over-expression of wild-type XKCNQ1 or a constitutively-active form of XKCNQ1, or exposure to the KCNQ1 activator RL-3 [51] resulted in no significant heterotaxia (1-2%, N>100 in each case).

[PAGE 6] XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 are expressed in embryos and asymmetrically localized at cleavage stages
To further characterize the roles of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in embryonic patterning we determined the expression of these two channel components at the mRNA and the protein levels. We first performed in situ hybridization of embryos and sections with an antisense probe for XKCNQ1. Maternal KCNQ1 mRNA is present in the egg prior to fertilization (Fig. 2A,B), and was detected during cleavage stages (Fig. 2C) but had disappeared by gastrulation (Fig. 2D). Zygotic expression of KCNQ1 was characterized and will be reported elsewhere (forthcoming).

Since, at early stages (cleavage prior to MBT), maternal proteins often possess a localization that may not match mRNA, we next used immunohistochemistry to ascertain protein presence. Western blotting revealed that the antibody we generated to a peptide in the native Xenopus sequence was specific for KCNQ1, giving one clean band of the expected size (Fig. 3A; signal disappeared completely when excess blocking peptide was first incubated with antibody). At the 2-cell stage, the stain was present at the cell surface of just one cell (Fig. 3B-D), and by the time the dorso-ventral and LR axes could be ascertained (4-cell stage), this was revealed to be the right ventral cell (Fig. 3E). Examination of protein in the epidermis during tailbud stages (Fig. 3F) revealed the predicted cell-membrane localization for this channel protein (Fig. 3G).

We next performed in situ hybridization of embryos and sections with an antisense probe for XKCNE1. Maternal XKCNE1 mRNA was detected in the egg prior to fertilization and in cleavage-stage embryos (Fig. 4A-D). The XKCNE1 antibody [45] recognizes a single band of the correct size on Western blots (Fig. 5A). At the protein level, XKCNE1 is localized asymmetrically at the first two cleavages, but was seen to be left-sided as well as right-sided (Fig. 5B-G) in a population of embryos. Unlike XKCNQ1, there was not a consistent asymmetry in its sidedness. We conclude that both XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 are present and asymmetrically localized at the very earliest stages of embryonic development, consistent with possible roles in LR patterning.

[PAGE 7] Asymmetric localization of XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 is driven by cytoskeletal organization
The cytoskeleton is a key component of ion transporter localization in epithelia [74-76] and specifically in LR patterning [15, 19, 77]. Thus, we asked whether the localization of XKCNE1 along the animal-vegetal or left-right axes was likewise dependent on microtubule or actin organization by treating early embryos with low doses of cytoskeletal disruptors (which is sufficient to specifically randomize left-right patterning [19]) and then assaying XKCNE1 or XKCNQ1 protein distribution in immunohistochemistry on blastomere sections at the 2-4 cell stages. Disruption of microtubules with Nocodozole abolished the normal asymmetric pattern of XKCNE1 localization (Fig. 6A,B) as well as diminishing the normally clear restriction of the XKCNE1 protein to the vegetal half of the early blastomeres (Fig. 6D,E). Disruption of actin structure with Latrunculin likewise alters the pattern, resulting in a tight central bolus of protein instead of the normal distribution throughout the vegetal half (Fig. 6D,F). Similarly, XKCNQ1 protein, which is normally present at the animal pole (Fig. 6G), becomes largely vegetally-localized after disruption of actin structure with Latrunculin (Fig. 6I), and its normal asymmetric pattern (Fig. 6J) is abolished by exposure to Nocodozole (Fig. 6K). We conclude that cytoskeletal structure is required for the normal localization of both subunits along the animal-vegetal and LR axes.

[PAGE 7] Discussion
XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 in Left-Right patterning
Pharmacological and molecular loss-of-function analyses implicate XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 as obligate components of left-right patterning. Since co-transfection of ER-retention KCNE1 mutants is known to reduce cell surface expression of KCNQ1 [73], it is not yet known whether the randomizing effect of KCNE1 dominant negative constructs is due to reduction of the number of KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes in the membrane, to reduction of their activity on the cell surface, or both. Misexpression of XKCNE3 (Mirp2), a regulatory subunit in the KCNE family that opens KCNQ1 but suppresses ERG channels [63, 78], had no effect on asymmetry. Together with lack of a randomizing effect of constitutively open KCNQ1 mutants or of exposure to RL-3 [51], these data suggest that XKCNQ1 is already activated by default (since molecular or pharmacological activation does not randomize asymmetry).

XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 proteins are present in embryos from prior to fertilization - long before the appearance of heart, neurons, or kidneys (tissues in which these channels are normally studied). Early embryos contain both maternal mRNA (Fig. 2, 4) and protein (Fig. 3, 5), and as previously described for several other ion transporters relevant to LR patterning [13, 15, 77], the distributions of mRNA and protein are not identical. While the possible role of differential degradation has not yet been explored, it is clear that one contributor to the specific localization of this channel is the cytoskeleton (Fig. 6), consistent with previous data implicating motor protein activity and oriented cytoskeletal tracks in asymmetric localization [19, 77], as well as with the known ability of adult mammalian cells to localize KCNQ1 along the apical-basal axis [79, 80].

[PAGE 8] Upstream components of the pathway: controls of XKCNQ1/XKCNE1 function
The expression of XKCNQ1 protein is asymmetrical, being localized to the right ventral cell (Fig. 3). While the plane of first cleavage can be experimentally repositioned [81, 82], in normal embryos the cleavage furrow usually corresponds to the future midline of the embryo [17, 18], and injection of one cell at the two-cell stage is routinely used to target half the embryo, allowing the contralateral half to serve as an internal control [83-85]. Thus, similarly to the V-ATPase [15] and H+/K+-ATPase [77] pumps, this early asymmetry of protein localization is predicted to align differences in ion flux (and thus, subsequent physiological asymmetries) with the prospective midline of LR asymmetry.

The asymmetric localization of XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 requires cytoskeletal organization (Fig. 6). This situation parallels the V-ATPase [15] and the H+/K+-ATPase [77], and indeed microtubule tracks are known to regulate a number of ion transporter systems in a variety of vertebrate cell types [74, 86-90]. Thus, the localization of this component of the early embryonic battery is dependent upon upstream intracellular polarity machinery.

[PAGE 8] Downstream components: how does XKCNQ1/XKCNE1 control asymmetry?
Prior work described models of mechanisms that transduce consistent asymmetries in bioelectric properties to subsequent steps canalized as asymmetric gene expression during gastrulation and neurulation [11, 21, 91, 92]. Asymmetric early distribution of the H+/K+-ATPase regulates left-right patterning by establishing differential membrane voltage gradients on the L and R sides [13, 21, 77] and indeed the importance of this pump for laterality has been documented in several vertebrate and invertebrate species [93-95]. Importantly however, this antiporter is electroneutral, since it swaps two positive charges in every cycle [96-98]. Our data on XKCNQ1 provide a possible resolution to the question of how the H+/K+-ATPase can control LR patterning (Fig. 7A).

XKCNQ1 contributes to resting potential [99, 100], and is a stabilizing component for transmembrane voltage in epithelial electrical polarity, including renal and gastrointestinal cells, as well as cells in the vestibule of the inner ear (all three of which are key sites for other bioelectrical systems necessary for LR patterning [11, 101, 102]). Thus, we suggest a similar function for this channel in the battery that exists on the ventral midline of Xenopus embryos (Fig. 7B): as in several mammalian tissues, where cellular K+ ions exit through

[PAGE 9] KCNQ1 channels to recycle K+ or maintain cell membrane potential [103], we propose that the function of XKCNQ1 channels in LR patterning is to provide an exit route for the potassium ions brought in by the H+/K+-ATPase, thus allowing this electroneutral antiporter to generate a change in membrane voltage by the net loss of positive ions in the right ventral blastomere. XKCNQ1 is an ideal candidate to function as part of the physiological module (including several channels and pumps) that generates the electrophoretic force for the known subsequent LR-asymmetric redistribution of small molecule morphogens through gap junctions [10]. Indeed, the potassium currents produced by KCNQ1 associated with members of the MiRP β subunits are activated by low extracellular pH [29, 104], a condition present at the right ventral blastomere's surface due to the action of the H+/K+-ATPase and V-ATPase pumps [13, 15]. Thus, the activity of XKCNQ1/XKCNE1 together with the two right-sided H+ pumps results in a bioelectrical cassette that is conserved among embryonic LR patterning and adult gut/kidney/inner ear function.

This model makes specific predictions about the spatio-temporal function of XKCNQ1/XKCNE1. First, it requires that their roles in LR patterning occur during early cleavages. Indeed, XKCNE1 DNA does not induce heterotaxia as does XKCNE1 mRNA (although the DNA does cause other phenotypes such as hyperpigmentation, serving as a positive control for its activity; the analysis of this phenotype will be presented elsewhere). The fact that post-MBT expression of XKCNE1 is unable to affect laterality is consistent with this class of models [11] where the effects of K+ modulation (and thus changes in Vmem) are paramount for LR patterning steps during cleavage stages in Xenopus. Similarly, a role in the LR physiological asymmetries requires that one or both of the components function differently on the L and R sides. Our data are consistent with this requirement, since we observed localization of XKCNQ1 maternal protein in the right ventral blastomere, precisely where the H+/K+-ATPase subunits are located.

What is the role of XKCNE1 in LR patterning? While the randomization by the dominant negative XKCNE1 construct (G46R, Table 2A) suggests that XKCNE1 itself is clearly necessary for normal LR patterning, the randomness of its localization with respect to the LR axis does not suggest straightforward models for how its presence contributes to consistent downstream asymmetry. It is possible that a balance (or net difference) of levels on the R and L sides is important, since global overexpression of both gain- and loss-of-function KCNE1 constructs both randomize asymmetry. This aspect remains puzzling, although this situation is not unprecedented in the field: localization of a kinesin-like protein that travels towards the "-" end of microtubules in Xenopus exhibits random asymmetry [77], as does the expression of Left-Right Dynein in the head-folds of the mouse [105]. Understanding the details of the early embryonic circuit will require probing in detail the roles of XKCNE1 and other accessory subunits. Nevertheless, the consistent asymmetry of the α subunit (XKCNQ1) fits into the known physiological circuit in a straightforward way (Fig. 7C).

[PAGE 9] Evolutionary conservation of potassium channel roles in asymmetry
We have previously proposed that the LR axis is fundamentally an instance of epithelial planar polarity [11]. In this model, the frequent association between laterality defects and polycystic kidney disease [106-108] is due to the fundamental role of cellular polarization in kidney and embryonic cells [109], and in particular to the concordance of apical-basal and planar polarity systems that allows cytoskeleton-mediated alignment of bioelectrical (physiological) and morphological polarities [77]. Our functional and expression data on XKCNQ1 are consistent with this proposal, in light of the function and polarized localization of KCNQ1 in kidney cells [79, 110], its cooperation with the H+/K+-ATPase to control ion flux and pH in the gut [25-29], and its role in a number of epithelia [111, 112]. Indeed, KCNQ1 is asymmetrically localized along the basal-apical axis in kidney cells [80], as are the other ion pumps that are now known to be important in LR patterning [11]. Importantly, KCNQ1 localization is controlled by the RAB11 GTPase [113], which is also implicated in the localization of components in the Drosophila wing and kidney cells [114-116] - classic examples of planar cell polarity.

[PAGE 10] The conservation of LR-relevant functions of XKCNQ1 and XKCNE1 to mammals is unclear. Genetic deletion of these loci in mice [103, 117] has not been reported to result in laterality defects. However
