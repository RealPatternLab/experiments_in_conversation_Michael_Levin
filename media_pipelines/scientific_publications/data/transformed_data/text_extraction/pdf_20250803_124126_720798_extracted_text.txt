[PAGE 2] Abstract
Aging, a ubiquitous process that affects almost all multicellular organisms, is accompanied by the accumulation of senescent cells, leading to a decline of morphology and function. The 'loss of morphostatic information' theory posits that aging occurs due to gradual breakdown of order initially established during embryo development. Spatial differences in cellular resting potential have many roles in organizing cell activity into complex anatomical structures during embryogenesis and regeneration. Thus, while bioelectric patterns are a good candidate for the information that degrades during aging, long-term changes in bioelectrical state in adult cells are not well-understood. Here, we sought to characterize the temporal and spatial bioelectric dynamics of human epidermal keratinocytes undergoing replicative senescence. We stained keratinocytes of varying ages using voltage sensitive dyes – BeRST, VoltageFluor 2.0 & 2.1 – and characterized p16 expression levels, senescence associated β-galactosidase activity, and chromatin condensation levels. Our results revealed senescence-associated membrane depolarization – a consistent change of bioelectrical potential over the lifespan of cells. Moreover, we found increased heterogeneity of V<sub>mem</sub> between cultures, reduced intra-culture variability, diminished cellular responsiveness to hyperpolarizing treatments, reduced resilience (ability to quickly and effectively achieve equilibrium post-perturbation), and degradation of multi-cellular patterns of bioelectric spatial organization. Modulation of resting membrane potential towards hyperpolarization abated, while depolarization exacerbated, senescence-associated phenotypes, demonstrating the instructive role of bioelectricity in replicative aging. These results reveal a breakdown of bioelectric patterning and regulation with senescence, consistent with the loss of morphostatic information theory of aging.


[PAGE 3] Introduction
Aging, the progressive decline of form and function, affects almost all multicellular organisms [1, 2]. Many theories have been proposed to explain the cause of aging, and generally fall into two broad categories: damaged-based and programmatic-based. Damaged-based theories argue that aging occurs due to the accumulation of damage caused by oxidative stress, DNA damage, and the progressive malfunction of cellular repair mechanisms [3, 4]. Conversely, programmatic-based theories posit that aging is hardwired into the genome to give an evolutionary benefit at the cost of a limited lifespan [5, 6]. Despite much effort consistent with these hypotheses, there is a notable lack of definitive anti-aging treatments [7]. This led to the emergence of the Information-loss theory of aging which posits that aging is caused due to the progressive loss of biological information required to maintain homeostasis [8]. This loss of information is said to occur at the level of the epigenome – changes in the methylation profiles lead to epigenetic drift, reducing the fidelity of information driving cellular processes, and causing loss of cell identity [8].

Theories of aging focused on loss of information at the genetic (telomere) or epigenetic levels can explain changes in cellular properties. However, resistance to aging is a whole-body phenomenon that is likely connected to the overall processes of embryogenesis and regeneration. Resistance to aging is not something that is only needed later in life – it is likely part of the general machinery needed for a body to maintain order against the daily replacement of cells and the molecular noise that constantly threaten to disrupt tissue- and organ-level structures [9, 10]. Aging can be seen as the eventual failure of fundamental, ubiquitous mechanisms that organize cellular and molecular events toward the maintenance and repair of the target morphology and away from degeneration and cancer [11-13].

One possible cause of aging is progressive loss of Morphostatic Information [2]. During development, cellular collectives traverse the anatomical morphospace (the latent space of potential geometric configurations), to reach their target morphology - a region within that space that corresponds to the correct anatomy of a given species [14, 15]. Importantly, even after development into an adult, maintaining the final adult morphology is a highly active state that must counteract environmental stress and noise. It is likely that the key to longevity is understanding the computational processes enabling cellular collectives to establish and maintain order at various scales. What maintains the information needed for continuous upkeep of structure, within a specific region of morphospace over decades? A number of mechanisms have been implicated in on-going morphostasis, including dynamic biochemical and biomechanical gradients. Here we focus on endogenous bioelectricity: an important modality that has been implicated in large-scale morphogenetic control in embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression [16-18].

Endogenous bioelectrical signaling is driven by ion channels and pumps, present in all cells – not only neurons. The resting potential of cells regulates proliferation, migration, differentiation, and gene expression [19-28]. However, as in the brain, bioelectric signaling is not just a factor determining single cell behavior: due to electrical synapses known as gap junctions [29] and large-scale trans-epithelial electric fields [30, 31], tissue-level bioelectric states propagate and integrate across considerable distances in vivo. Spatial patterns of resting membrane potential have been shown to regulate the morphogenesis of the wing, eye, heart, limb, and brain in a range of model species and human patients (reviewed in [16-18, 32, 33]), and it is becoming clear that bioelectric regionalization provides an important underlying scaffold for defining tissue boundaries and organ-level structure [34]. Recent work has especially shown that a number of birth defects, induced both chemically and genetically, exert their teratogenic influence by blurring the endogenous bioelectric prepatterns that set the size and shape of the brain; moreover, the sharpness of these patterns are an attractive target for therapeutics because reinforcing the crisp boundaries between different bioelectric regions results in repair of severe defects of brain, gut, and heart [35-38]. Interestingly, cancer -

[PAGE 4] another loss of tissue-level order, which a human intact body must battle for decades [9, 39] – can likewise be induced by disruptions of endogenous bioelectric states and normalized by therapeutic restoration of V<sub>mem</sub> and gap junctional connectivity [40-45].

While much work on V<sub>mem</sub> patterns has occurred in various model systems [46, 47], less is known about human cells, a prerequisite for developing therapeutics. More generally, while resting potential of human cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells in culture [48-54], has been studied, it is not known what kind of multicellular patterns would exist in vitro, a scenario different from the cells' usual evolutionarily-established organ context, in which embryonic organizer processes are not available to regionalize V<sub>mem</sub> patterns. Finally, the changes in bioelectric pattern over long timescales, beyond embryogenesis, are not well-characterized. Thus, here we sought to address these knowledge gaps by studying bioelectric states in human cells in vitro, during their natural process of senescence, using a state-of-the-art voltage dye visualization method that goes beyond first-generation bioelectric profiling methods [55, 56].

While there is a paucity of research into the role of bioelectricity in aging, some researchers have investigated ion channels and membrane potential changes in senescing cells. Plasma membrane depolarization has been suggested to be an important trigger for the induction of senescence [57-59], via depolarization as a result of increased expression of voltage-gated sodium channels [58, 59]. Knocking down these channels prevented the expression of p53 and the downregulation of mitotic genes [59]. Experiments exposing cells to depolarizing treatments were shown to exacerbate replicative aging and induce senescence [58, 59]. Together with the functional evidence for a role of bioelectric patterns in regenerative, embryonic, and neoplastic contexts [60, 61], these data suggest the importance of bioelectricity not only as a biomarker of aging, but also reveal it to have a functional role in cellular senescence.

Thus, we proposed a model in which loss of morphostatic information is specifically due to spatial bioelectric patterns' degrading with age, becoming blurred and thus making it more difficult for individual cells, even when replaced with new progeny, to take on appropriate system-level roles within the anatomical structure [1]. This model makes a number of non-mutually exclusive predictions, which we tested here: (a) is there an absolute shift in mean V<sub>mem</sub> during senescence? (b) is there a reduction of precision (increase in variance) among cells as they age? (c) is there spatial order (separated domains of resting potential) which becomes less distinct over time? And (d) does cells' ability to respond to bioelectric signals [62], or resilience (time to return to equilibrium after perturbation) decline in senescence?

To explore these ideas, we used human keratinocytes isolated from the neonatal epidermis. Progenitor keratinocytes residing in the basal layer of the epidermis initially undergo proliferation, then differentiate while migrating towards the surface of the skin [63]. However, with increasing age, progenitor keratinocytes in the basal and spinous layer increasingly become senescent, reducing the skin's regenerative potential, thinning the epidermis, and impairing homeostasis [64]. As keratinocytes are the dominant cell type in skin, in vitro cultures provide researchers with a highly relevant model for studying skin aging processes such as senescence.

The present study aimed to determine the presence of age-dependent changes in the spatial patterning, responsiveness, and resilience of aging human epidermal keratinocytes' bioelectric states. We found that senescent-associated membrane depolarization is accompanied by increased bioelectric inter-culture and reduced intra-culture heterogeneity with respect to resting potential, diminished cellular responsiveness and resilience, as well as degradation of bioelectric spatial organization. Moreover, we report that modulation of resting membrane potential towards hyperpolarization abated senescence associated phenotypes, while depolarization exacerbated these phenotypes.


[PAGE 5] Methods
Cell Culture
To grow cells of varying ages, isolated Human Epidermal Keratinocytes-neonatal (HEK-n) (Science Cell Cat: 2100) were cultured in a T75 flask precoated with poly-L-lysine (Science Cell CAT: 0403) for 24-hours at 37°C. HEK-n cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 hours before being given fresh keratinocyte media (Science Cell CAT:2101). The cell culture media was replaced every two days until reaching 80% confluency, after which they were split into T75 flasks and grown until the desired age was reached, after which they were cryopreserved in keratinocyte media containing 10% DMSO.

Bioelectric Imaging of Resting Voltage Potential
A week prior to imaging, HEK-n cells were thawed from cryopreservation and cultured onto 10-cm² culture dishes containing 20-ml of keratinocyte media, and kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 6-hours. The media was then replaced with fresh keratinocyte media to remove any traces of DMSO. Cells were cultured in a 96-well plate precoated with Poly-L Lysine at least 48-hours prior to V<sub>mem</sub> characterization. Prior to timeseries imaging, cells were incubated with 600 nM of BeRST for 30 minutes, washed twice with PBS, and imaged with the Leica SP8 Confocal microscope for Fluorescence Lifetime characterization. FLIM images were acquired by exciting the BeRST dye at 658-nm and collecting the emission in the range of 681-nm – 800 nm. FLIM images were fitted with a biexponential decay curve, exported as '.Tif' files, then loaded into ImageJ for cell segmentation by ‘Ostu' thresholding. Then the mean Lifetime was calculated for each cell. These data were then transferred to Prism GraphPad for graphing or R-studio for statistical testing.

Global and Local Moran's I – Calculation of Spatial Autocorrelation
To acquire FLIM images for spatial analysis, we used the V<sub>mem</sub> sensitive Vf2.1 and the V<sub>mem</sub> insensitive Vf2.0 dyes. The difference between these two fluorophores is that Vf2.0 lacks the aniline donor group which is crucial for voltage sensitivity. Consequently, this dye can be used to determine the contribution of any non-V<sub>mem</sub> artifacts. For example, we found that using higher concentrations of VF2.0 led to quenching, consequently creating what appeared to be ‘depolarized' regions in the culture. Reducing the concentration down to 50 nM of Vf2.0 gave rise to images that appeared to have a more random distribution of Lifetime values (Supplementary Figure 1). This concentration was then used to acquire large image cells with the voltage sensitive VF2.1 dye for spatial analysis.

To perform Moran's I computation, HEK-n cells of different ages were cultured in a flat bottom 96-well plate 24-hr prior to imaging. Cells were stained with 50 nM VF2.1 (ex: 488-nm, em: 500 – 700 nm) and with 1 µM of Hoechst (Ex: 405-nm, Em: 420 – 480 nm) for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Keratinocytes were imaged with the Leica SP8 Confocal microscope paired with a 25x air Objective (refer to metadata of Leica Image File for image settings/parameters). To generate centroid X, Centroid Y, and intensity values for each cell, background pixels were zeroed by creating masks via Otsu thresholding of intensity images, then applying the mask to the FLIM images. A python script was written to use a 15 x 15 pixel ROI to scan the image and only save X, Y, and Lifetime values of regions in the image that had no background pixels (i.e. pixel values >0). These data were then saved as a csv file. Prior to Moran's computation, an elbow test was performed to determine the appropriate k value which was revealed to be k=3. For this computation we subsampled our data using 1000 cells at a time and took the average over 10 iterations to account for differences in cell number.


[PAGE 6] Senescence Associated β-galactosidase characterization
Keratinocytes of varying ages were cultured onto a 96-well plate at least 48-hours prior to βGal characterization. Detection of SA-β-Gal was performed according to the manufacturer's specification (Cell Signaling Technologies, Cat: 9860). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with the fixative solution, rinsed and then stained with the staining solution. Then the 96-well plate was sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation prior to incubation for 24 hours in a dry incubator (no CO<sub>2</sub>). The cells were then stained with Hoechst 3342 and imaged using EVOS M7000. Images of SA-β-Gal-stained cells were analyzed in ImageJ using the protocol developed by Krzystynial et al [65]. Their analysis involves color thresholding images to mask positively stained cells, then measuring the integrated density of the inversed image. This value is then divided by the number of nuclei to generate the 'integrated density of β Gal signal per cell'.

RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen 'RNeasy Mini Kit' (Cat: 74104) according to manufacturer's instructions. To synthesize cDNA using 200 ng of isolated RNA, the BioRad iScript cDNA synthesis (Cat: 1725035) kit was used. The expression level of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> mRNA was determined using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Fisher Scientific, Cat: A25777) using the following primers: FWD ‘CTCGTGCTGATGCTACTGAGGA' and RVS ‘GGTCGGCGCAGTTGGGCTCC'. The following PCR parameters were used: Activation: 50 °C for 2 min; Stage 2: pre-soak: 95 °C for 10 min; Stage 3: Denaturation: 95 °C for 15 sec, Annealing: 60°C for 1 min; Stage 4: Melting curve: 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 15 sec, 95°C for 15 sec.  Absolute quantification of mRNA transcripts was performed using the Linear Regression of Efficiency method [66]. This approach works because during PCR the amplification efficiency progressively decreases as the amplicon concentration increases, and therefore, this reduction is linearly coupled to the amplicon DNA mass. For all RT-qPCR quantification, 100 femtograms of lambda DNA was used as a standard to quantify p16<sup>INK4A</sup> mRNA.


[PAGE 7] Results
Senescent Keratinocytes Exhibit Depolarization, and Reduced Intra-culture, but Increased Inter-culture, V<sub>mem</sub> Heterogeneity
To characterize the baseline bioelectrics of aging human epidermal keratinocytes, we imaged cells of different ages stained with 600 nM BeRST, a V<sub>mem</sub> sensitive fluorophore [67-71]. BeRST is comprised of a silicon rhodamine fluorophore attached to a phenylvenevinylene molecular wire that is sensitive to changes in the electric field [55, 70]. The mechanism underpinning the voltage sensing involves photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Staining cells with BeRST results in the molecular wire embedding into the plasma membrane, while the silicon rhodamine head resides on the surface. If the membrane potential is hyperpolarized, the electron-rich molecular wire quenches the head, causing a reduction in fluorescence and Lifetime. Upon membrane depolarization, the PeT mechanism is disrupted, leading to an increase in fluorescence and Lifetime from the silicon rhodamine head [67, 68, 70, 71]. This dye provides important advantages over other voltage dyes currently being used. Firstly, it has a near-far red excitation, reducing photo-toxicity and enabling long-term live imaging. Secondly, since PeT underpins the voltage sensing mechanism of this dye – unlike other dyes that use the movement of a charged fluorophore in/out of the cell - the fluorescence intensity and Lifetime is not altered by changes in membrane permeability. This reduces artifacts introduced by differential dye uptake by cells.

Our results revealed significant depolarization of Keratinocytes upon reaching 40- (p<0.05, n=4 biological replicates) and 50-days (p<0.05, n=13 biological replicates) in culture (Figure 1A) relative to 10-day old cells (n=9 biological replicates). This coincided with increased levels of three aging biomarkers: p16<sup>INK4A</sup> [72] expression, SA-β-galactosidase [73] activity, and chromatin condensation levels [74] (p<0.05, n=4 biological replicates; p<0.0001, n=6 biological replicates; p<0.0001, n=6 biological replicates). Moreover, the degree of V<sub>mem</sub> heterogeneity between biological replicate cultures in a given age group, as measured by the size of standard deviation, became greater than 22-fold at day 40 and 15-fold at 50 days relative to 10-day old cells. In contrast, within each biological replicate, i.e. within a single culture, levels of heterogeneity were 38% lower in 50-day old (n=16 biological replicates) compared to 10-day (p<0.0001, n=9 biological replicates) old keratinocytes. Taken together, these data show that during senescence, keratinocytes undergo a change in the bioelectric state from polarization to depolarization which is accompanied by increased inter-culture V<sub>mem</sub> heterogeneity and reduced intra-culture heterogeneity. These results show these bioelectric patterns as biomarkers of replicative senescence.

Senescent Keratinocytes are Less Responsive and Less Resilient to Induced Changes of V<sub>mem</sub>
We next investigated age-dependent changes in responsiveness of keratinocytes to bioelectric signals, which is of relevance to both – design of external interventions via electroceutical drugs [46, 75-77] and the understanding of responsiveness of cells to endogenous bioelectric signals in vivo [34]. To trigger a V<sub>mem</sub> change, we used the hyperpolarizing drug Pinacidil, a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activator [78]. We acquired images of keratinocytes stained with BeRST pre- and post-treatment to calculate the percentage change in Fluorescence Lifetime (Figure 3A). Keratinocytes progressively exhibited greater absolute percentage change in Lifetime, peaking on day 30 (p<0.0001, n=3 biological replicates). However, by day 40 keratinocytes appear to have the most diminished response level, albeit statistically not significantly different than day 10. In 50-day old senescent cultures, keratinocytes responded by depolarizing (Figure 3A) when exposed to pinacidil. These data show that keratinocytes become increasingly more responsive to Pinacidil treatment up to day 30; however, once they approach and achieve senescence (Figure 3A),


[PAGE 8] they become not only less responsive but also depolarize when given a hyperpolarizing stimulus.
To determine the presence of age-dependent changes in keratinocyte's resilience to V<sub>mem</sub> perturbations, we calculated the level of time series' variance post treatment with Pinacidil. In system Dynamics, Resilience is the ability of a complex system to adapt to a new equilibrium post perturbation [1]. A system that is resilient will quickly and effectively adjust to a new setpoint, exhibiting little variance [1]; conversely, a frail system will struggle with adjusting to a new setpoint, exhibiting greater variance in their response. The Variance of each age group was calculated by using the standard deviation of each timeseries. This analysis revealed 50-day old cells with the highest level of variance compared to younger cells exposed to Pinacidil (p<0.05 day 10 vs. 50-day, n=3 and n=8 biological replicates, respectively). Furthermore, old senescent cultures immediately depolarized when given pinacidil followed by hyperpolarization, then a gradual progression towards depolarization. These data reveal that senescent cells have the lowest degree of V<sub>mem</sub> resilience, and they fail to achieve a steady hyperpolarized state despite an initial attempt.

Senescent Keratinocytes Lose Ability to Form Distinct Bioelectric Domains
We next sought to determine whether cells in culture exhibit large-scale spatial regionalization with respect to V<sub>mem</sub> (as observed in bioelectric patterns in vivo [61, 79, 80]) and whether this changes with age. To this end, we used the voltage insensitive ‘VoltageFluor 2.0' and voltage sensitive ‘VoltageFluor 2.1' which are analogs of BeRST. These fluorophores have a Sulfofluorescein rather than a rhodamine fluorophore so they are excitable with 488-nm light. The Vf2.0 dye lacks the aniline donor group which results in no PeT mechanism and is therefore not voltage sensitive. Using VF2.0 revealed concentration dependent quenching that gave rise to what appeared to be distinct voltage domains (Supplementary Figure 1). However, upon reducing the concentration down to 50 nM, the VF2.0 images appeared to have a more random distribution of Lifetime values (Supplementary Figure 1). This concentration was used to stain keratinocytes with VF2.1 for spatial autocorrelation characterization.

Surprisingly, we found that even in vitro - in the absence of exogenous morphogenetic cues - the cells self-organized into domains (Figure 4). This was particularly apparent in 10-day old keratinocytes evident by the relatively high positive Global Moran's I of 0.5 (Figure 4A). This metric measures the degree of spatial autocorrelation – Moran's I value close to +1 indicates a strong positive spatial correlation, values close to zero indicate random spatial patterning, while negative values imply dissimilar values are adjacent [81]. Furthermore, to investigate whether aging affects Keratinocyte's bioelectric spatial organization, we computed Moran's Global and Local I for each age. This metric allowed us to quantify the spatial “sharpness” of bioelectric patterns – the crispness with which adjacent regions maintained differences in V<sub>mem</sub>. Compared to 10-day old cultures (n=10 biological replicates), a significant reduction in Moran's I from 0.5 down to 0.13 in 40-day (p<0.0001, n=7 biological replicates) and 0.26 in 50-day old cells (p<0.0001, n=10 biological replicates) was observed. A reduction in linear regression was also observed when plotting the Lifetime values against spatially lagged Lifetime (Figure 4B-i) – the distribution of points became progressively more random with increasing age (Figure 4B-i). Moreover, computing and mapping Local Moran's I revealed a reduction in the size and distribution of distinct clusters with increasing age (Figure 4B-ii). Taken together these data show a loss of bioelectric spatial organization and reduced spatial heterogeneity (loss of ability to maintain coherent, distinct voltage regions) with increasing age.


[PAGE 9] Bioelectric Modulation of Keratinocytes Alters Senescence-Associated Phenotypes
To ascertain whether bioelectricity is a simple read-out of senescence rather than a highly relevant lever that can control cellular aging, we modulated keratinocyte resting membrane potential and characterized its impact on senescence biomarkers. To this end, we grew 30-day old cells an additional 6-days in either control media, media containing 10 µM Pinacidil or elevated potassium ion levels (+25 mM potassium gluconate). After 6 days, keratinocytes were cultured in fresh control media for 2 additional days until imaging. Figure 5A reveals a significantly higher number of cell nuclei in pinacidil treated (p<0.0001, n=18 biological replicates) and lower numbers in potassium gluconate treated cell cultures (p<0.05, n=24 biological replicates) relative to control cells (n=17 biological replicates). βGal staining revealed depolarizing treatment with potassium gluconate (n=6 biological replicates) increased levels of staining compared to control group (p<0.001, n=12 biological replicates). It was also apparent that despite the decrease in βGal staining levels of pinacidil treated cells, this difference was not statistically significant, likely due to the large standard deviation in the control group (Figure 5B). Notably, potassium gluconate treated cells appeared more solitary than control or pinacidil treated cells. This was especially apparent by cells heavily stained for βGal activity. This data suggests that senescent keratinocytes may have altered gap junctions which diminish their ability to bioelectrically communicate with each other. Analysis of chromatin condensation levels revealed significant decrease in pinacidil treated cells (p<0.05, control n=18 biological replicates, pinacidil n=16 biological replicates). Potassium gluconate treated cells appeared to have significantly higher levels of chromatin condensation (p<0.0001, n=2 biological replicates). Taken together, these data show hyperpolarization abates, while depolarization exacerbates, senescence markers.

To determine if hyperpolarization of keratinocytes also helped abate diminished cellular responsiveness associated with cellular senescence, we acquired timeseries images of keratinocytes pre- and post-treatment with Pinacidil. Our results revealed that keratinocytes pre-treated with pinacidil for 6 days exhibited the greatest degree of responsiveness (p<0.01, control n=4 biological replicates, Pinacidil n=3 biological replicates) when exposed to fresh media containing 10 µM of pinacidil (Figure 6A). Conversely, cells pre-treated with elevated potassium levels (+25 mM potassium gluconate) exhibited the lowest levels of responsiveness (n=3 biological replicates), albeit this diminished responsiveness was not statistically significant relative to the control group; however, it is suggestive. Notably, Figure 6B reveals that although pre-treated pinacidil cultures had the highest levels of responsiveness, they in fact progressively depolarized with time (Figure 6B). In contrast, pre-treated potassium cells appeared to initially depolarize but then progressively hyperpolarized when exposed to pinacidil. Control cells exhibited an initial recovery from depolarization, followed by oscillation near +10%. Taken together, these data reveal that while hyperpolarization abates diminished cellular responsiveness associated with senescence, the cellular response is altered so that cells depolarize when given a hyperpolarizing stimulus.

We next investigated the impact of V<sub>mem</sub> modulation on bioelectric spatial clustering and organization. Figure 7A reveals no significant difference between control cells and cells pre-treated with Pinacidil for 6 days. However, it appears that pre-treatment with elevated potassium ions significantly reduced Moran's I from 0.64 down to 0.26 (p<0.01, control n=4 biological replicates, potassium gluconate n=4 biological replicates). This is also evident in the Lifetime vs spatial lag Lifetime scatter plots which show that pre-treated potassium keratinocytes have a reduced R² value of 0.31 vs 0.67 in the control group, and by the more random distribution of points (Figure 7B-i). Performing local Moran analysis also revealed that the size and distribution of distinct clusters was significantly reduced (Figure 7B-ii). These data demonstrate that hyperpolarization via Pinacidil did not significantly improve V<sub>mem</sub> clustering, while depolarization significantly diminished keratinocytes' ability to self-organize in distinct V<sub>mem</sub> domains.


[PAGE 10] Discussion
Here, we characterized bioelectric patterns associated with keratinocyte senescence. We determined the relative V<sub>mem</sub> of keratinocytes stained with the voltage responsive dye – BeRST, while also quantifying aging biomarkers: p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression levels [72], senescence associated β-galactosidase activity [73], and senescence associated chromatin condensation. Our results revealed that keratinocytes significantly depolarize after 50 days in culture (Figure 1). This timepoint coincides with a significant increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup> expression, β-galactosidase activity, and chromatin condensation levels (Figure 2). These data reveal depolarization as a biomarker of keratinocyte replicative senescence and is in agreement with previous research showing significant membrane depolarization as a crucial step for the induction of senescence [58, 59, 82].

We also found that the inter-culture heterogeneity of cells' V<sub>mem</sub> values were significantly greater in 40 and 50-day old senescent keratinocyte cultures (Figure 1C). Paradoxically, we observed a significant reduction in intra-culture V<sub>mem</sub> heterogeneity at 50 days relative to earlier timepoints. This suggests that biological replicates of older senescing cells will vary because some replicates would have already achieved senescence while others are still pre-senescent. However, possibly due to the loss of proliferative or differentiating cells, individual older senescing keratinocyte cultures exhibit more homogenous V<sub>mem</sub> distributions within a given culture. While it is known that senescent cultures exhibit increased levels of cell-to-cell variability with respect to many aging biomarkers [83], the current study reports that old senescing keratinocytes exhibit reduced V<sub>mem</sub> heterogeneity within the same culture and increased levels between replicate cultures.

Homeostatic processes, such as the ones that enable cells to cooperate towards reaching and maintaining a specific large-scale target morphology, can fail in one of several ways. For example, they can lose setpoint information, and/or, they can become unable to implement the error minimization steps even if the setpoint information is available to them. Thus, over time, one way in which the on-going maintenance of the body can be disrupted is through progressive degradation of bioelectrically-encoded information. Our data on V<sub>mem</sub> changes during senescence is consistent with this. Another possible failure point of the morphological homeostasis cycle in vivo could be diminished responsiveness of individual cells to signals that drive collective behavior [2]. It is known that with increasing age cells have a reduced response to growth factors [84], hormones [85], immune signals [86], and even nutrients e.g. aged muscle cells show reduced sensitivity to amino acids such as leucine [87]. Here we investigated whether the ability to implement instructive bioelectrical signals likewise reduces over time, by determining cell's responsiveness to a V<sub>mem</sub>-altering drug. We characterized, at different ages, the V<sub>mem</sub> of cells pre- and post-treatment with Pinacidil – K<sub>ATP</sub> agonist [78] (Figure 3). Results show that keratinocytes become increasingly more responsive to hyperpolarization until day 30; however, upon approaching and achieving senescence on 40-50 days of culture, a significant reduction in responsiveness is observed (Figure 3). In fact, it appears that 50-day old senescent cultures undergo depolarization rather than hyperpolarization when exposed to pinacidil. Immediately after exposure to pinacidil, 50-day old senescent cultures became depolarized and then they ostensibly attempt a correction with hyperpolarization; however, they seem unable to maintain a hyperpolarized state. This data suggests that even if senescing cells produce and receive the signals needed to maintain tissue-level bioelectrical order, they may be incapable of responding appropriately. If this phenomenon holds in vivo, then it would mean that senescent cells contribute to disrupting tissue homeostasis not only by their diminished responsivity to bioelectric/morphogenetic cues, but by executing the wrong response. The accumulation of these senescent cells in tissue would increasingly lead to a progressive loss of morphostatic information stored in bioelectric gradients. These data also reveal that bioelectric interventions aiming to prevent senescence should target keratinocytes when they are most responsive, i.e., before they achieve senescence.  Spatial analysis of V<sub>mem</sub> patterns in keratinocytes revealed the presence of distinct bioelectric domains, even in the absence of exogenous morphogenetic cues (Figure 4). This was particularly apparent in younger keratinocytes, as evidenced by the relatively high positive Global Moran's I value. However, with increasing age, a significant reduction in Moran's I was observed, indicating a loss of spatial organization and a more random distribution of V<sub>mem</sub> values. This suggests that senescent keratinocytes lose their ability to maintain coherent, distinct voltage regions, which could contribute to the breakdown of tissue-level order observed in aging.  To further investigate the role of bioelectricity in senescence, we modulated keratinocyte resting membrane potential and characterized its impact on senescence biomarkers (Figure 5). Hyperpolarization with Pinacidil led to a significant increase in cell number and a decrease in chromatin condensation levels, while depolarization with potassium gluconate had the opposite effect. These findings suggest that bioelectric modulation can influence the senescent phenotype, with hyperpolarization potentially delaying senescence and depolarization accelerating it.  We also examined the impact of V<sub>mem</sub> modulation on cellular responsiveness (Figure 6). Keratinocytes pre-treated with Pinacidil exhibited the greatest degree of responsiveness to subsequent Pinacidil treatment, while those pre-treated with potassium gluconate showed the lowest responsiveness. This indicates that hyperpolarization can maintain cellular responsiveness, while depolarization can further diminish it.  Finally, we analyzed the effect of V<sub>mem</sub> modulation on spatial clustering and organization (Figure 7). Pre-treatment with potassium gluconate significantly reduced Moran's I, indicating a loss of spatial organization. This suggests that depolarization can disrupt the ability of keratinocytes to self-organize into distinct V<sub>mem</sub> domains, further supporting the link between bioelectric dysregulation and senescence.


[PAGE 13] Conclusion
The present study describes the bioelectrics of senescing keratinocytes, both in terms of the V<sub>mem</sub> patterns they generate and in turn their ability to respond to bioelectric signals. We observed changes in both of these dimensions of anatomical homeostasis, consistent with the bioelectric emphasis of the 'Loss of Morphostatic Information' theory of aging [105]. Future work will explore bioelectric patterns, and the mechanisms that interpret changes therein, as potential targets for longevity therapeutics.
