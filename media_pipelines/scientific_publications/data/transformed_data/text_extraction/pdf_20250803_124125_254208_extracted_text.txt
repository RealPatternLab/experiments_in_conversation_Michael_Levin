Fusicoccin signaling reveals 14-3-3 protein function as a novel step in left-right patterning during amphibian embryogenesis

Summary
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of morphogenetic signals by H+ flux during embryogenesis, we tested Fusicoccin-A (FC), a compound produced by the fungus *Fusicoccum amygdali* Del. In plant cells, FC complexes with 14-3-3 proteins to activate H+ pumping across the plasma membrane. It has long been thought that FC acts on higher plants only; here, we show that exposing frog embryos to FC during early development specifically results in randomization of the asymmetry of the left-right (LR) axis (heterotaxia). Biochemical and molecular-genetic evidence is presented that 14-3-3-family proteins are an obligate component of *Xenopus* FC receptors and that perturbation of 14-3-3 protein function results in heterotaxia. The subcellular localization of 14-3-3 mRNAs and proteins reveals novel cytoplasmic destinations, and a left-right asymmetry at the first cell division. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we show that 14-3-3E protein is likely to be an endogenous and extremely early aspect of LR patterning. These data highlight a striking conservation of signaling pathways across kingdoms, suggest common mechanisms of polarity establishment between *C. elegans* and vertebrate embryos, and uncover a novel entry point into the pathway of left-right asymmetry determination.

[PAGE 1] Introduction
The role of ion flux in controlling morphogenetic events during embryonic development and regeneration is becoming increasingly recognized as an important component alongside well-studied biochemical factors (Borgens et al., 1989; Nuccitelli, 1992; Robinson and Messerli, 1996; Altizer et al., 2001; Levin, 2003a). In particular, H+ flux and the resulting pH gradients are known to be crucial in embryonic development and neoplastic progression (Perona and Serrano, 1988; Grandin and Charbonneau, 1989; Martinez-Zaguilan and Gillies, 1992; Uzman et al., 1998; Levin et al., 2002). As part of our effort to understand the contribution of endogenous ion flows and gradients to patterning (Cheng et al., 2002; Rutenberg et al., 2002; Levin et al., 2002), we have begun to characterize signaling pathways that control proton flux across cell membranes.
Fusicoccin (FC) is a metabolite of the plant pathogen *Fusicoccum amygdali* Del. The toxin is remarkably effective in stimulating a number of physiological processes in higher plants, including stomatal opening, cellular respiration and radicle emergence from seed embryos (Marre, 1979; Kinoshita and Shimazaki, 1999). FC binds with high affinity to a receptor that is formed from an interaction of proteins from the 14-3-3 family with the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Korthout and De Boer, 1994; Olsson et al., 1998; Palmgren, 2001). 14-3-3 proteins are a family of acidic, soluble proteins with a number of key signaling roles in cell cycle, apoptosis and prion diseases (Baldin, 2000; Fu et al., 2000). Binding of 14-3-3 to the C-terminal (regulatory) domain of the H+ pump releases its auto-inhibitory action (Baunsgaard et al., 1998; Palmgren, 2001), which results in increased H+-extrusion along with changes in cytoplasmic pH (Felle et al., 1986). Despite the considerable structural conservation of 14-3-3 proteins from plants and animals (Fu et al., 2000; Sehnke et al., 2002), and the large number of 14-3-3 partners identified thus far in both kingdoms (Van Hemert et al., 2001), the presence of FC binding sites in organisms other than higher plants has never been demonstrated (Meyer et al., 1993).
Modulation of H⁺ currents is a hallmark of FC action; pH is a key regulator of many cellular parameters, such as gap-junctional communication between cells, which in turn is known to control a number of physiological processes (Levin, 2001). These considerations prompted us to investigate whether FC might be able to perturb embryonic patterning in a tractable vertebrate embryonic model, the frog *Xenopus laevis*, and thus be a useful tool to shed light on endogenous morphogenetic mechanisms. Interestingly, we found that exposure to FC had one major effect on embryogenesis: randomization of the left-right (LR) axis. The consistent asymmetry in the morphogenesis and placement of the heart, gut, brain and other asymmetric organs in normal individuals is very strongly conserved across evolution (Neville, 1976). Deviations from the normal pattern of asymmetry (situs solitus) have significant medical implications for human patients with laterality defects (Kosaki and Casey, 1998), and this fascinating biological problem is now beginning to be understood in molecular detail (Burdine and Schier, 2000; Mercola and Levin, 2001; Yost, 2001). However, very early LR patterning events are poorly understood and considerable debate exists as to how early embryos of various species can align the LR axis. Our characterization of FC signaling reveals that 14-3-3E protein is asymmetrically localized in *Xenopus* at the first cell cleavage and represents a novel, very early step in the LR pathway.

[PAGE 2] Materials and methods
Assaying embryonic situs
Embryos were anesthetized by Tricaine, and scored at stage 45 by non-invasive light microscopy for the situs of the heart, gut and gall-bladder. Data was analyzed using the χ2 test with Yates correction (for higher stringency).

Homogenization of embryos for biochemical analysis
Stage 5/6 or stage 10 embryos (5 g) were ground under liquid nitrogen in a mortar until a fine powder was obtained. 2 ml of homogenization buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and 1 complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Biochemicals) per 50 ml buffer] was then added and the suspension ground until liquid. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2500 *g* and the pellet (which consists mainly of residual yolk protein) was discarded. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 *g* for 15 minutes and the pellet discarded. Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged for 60 minutes at 100,000 *g* and the resulting pellet (microsomal fraction) and supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) collected.

Fusicoccin binding assay
Binding assays were performed in glass tubes in 20 mM Mes-Tris (pH 6.5), 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgSO4, 2.3 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 5×10-8 M [3H]9'-nor-fusicoccin-8'-alcohol at 30°C. The final incubation volume was 0.9 ml and reactions were incubated for 3 hours. The incubation was started by the addition of 4 mg microsomal or cytoplasmic protein extract. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml ice-cold wash buffer (25 mM glycine-KOH, pH 9.5) to the tubes and adding this, together with another 4 ml of wash buffer, on a Millipore filtration manifold. Rapid filtration was performed through polyethyleneimine (1% w/w) pre-treated Whatman GF/B filters, which were washed with 5 ml distilled water and 5 ml wash buffer just before filtration. The filters were then washed twice with 5 ml of wash buffer. The whole procedure of filtering and washing took about 30 seconds. The filters were then transferred to 5 ml Pharmacia Optiphase HiSafe 3 cocktail. After 24 hours extraction, the radioactivity was measured for 5 minutes with a LKB Wallac Rackbeta 1219 liquid scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was measured in saturation experiments by the inclusion of 10 μM unlabelled FC. The binding data of the saturation and competition experiments were analyzed with Sigmaplot 5.0. P-peptide was used at a final concentration of 1 µM. Further deviations from the protocol are mentioned in the text and figures.

Chromogenic *in situ* hybridization
*In situ* hybridization was performed according to a standard protocol (Harland, 1991). Briefly, *Xenopus* embryos were collected and fixed in MEMFA. Prior to *in situ* hybridization, embryos were washed in PBS+0.1% Tween-20 and then transferred to methanol through a 25%/50%/75% series. Probes for *in situ* hybridization were generated *in vitro* from linearized templates using DIG-labeling mix (Roche). Chromogenic reaction times were optimized for signal: background ratio.

Drug exposure
FC was obtained from Professor G. S. Muromtsev (Moscow), and tested using the lettuce seed germination assay (Lado et al., 1974) before use with embryos, as the FC obtained from Sigma was found to be of variable quality. FC was used at 50 µM in 0.1×MMR medium in systemic application experiments. Consistent with previous biochemical studies, which found optimal FC binding to receptors at lower pH (Drabkin et al., 1997), we observed that the maximal effect was achieved with FC dissolved in 0.1×MMR at pH<6 (embryos raised in medium with pH in the range 5 to 8 exhibit the normal control levels of heterotaxia: <1%, n=180).

Microinjection
For microinjection, peptides and mRNA were dissolved in water and injected into embryos in 3% Ficoll using standard methods (100 millisecond pulses in each injected cell with borosilicate glass needles calibrated for a bubble pressure of 55-62 kPa in water). Peptide stock was 2.6 mM in water; approximately 2.7 nl were injected into each cell. After 30 minutes, embryos were washed in 0.75×MMR for 30 minutes and cultured in 0.1×MMR until desired stages.

Immunohistochemistry
Embryos were fixed overnight in MEMFA and stored at 4°C in PBTr (1×PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100). They were embedded in gelatin/albumin medium and sectioned at 40 µm on a Leica vibratome. The sections were washed three times in PBTr, blocked with 10% goat serum and incubated with primary antibody at 1:200 in PBTr overnight. They were then washed six times with PBTr and incubated with an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody overnight. After six washes in PBTr, detection was carried out using NBT and BCIP (X-Phos). Detection times were optimized for signal:noise ratio.


[PAGE 2] Results
Fusicoccin exposure induces heterotaxia
To examine the effects of FC on vertebrate development, *Xenopus* embryos were cultured in medium containing FC from fertilization to stage 14 (a time period long prior to the morphogenesis of asymmetric organs) and examined at stage 43. Development was apparently normal, with the exception of heterotaxia (Fig. 1; Table 1A). FC exposure induced a 25% rate of reversals in any one of the three organs evaluated: the heart, gut and gall-bladder, on a background of 1% heterotaxia observed in control (χ2=81.2, *P*<2·10-19). Analysis of the phenotype induced by FC reveals that it is a loss of concordance between the three organs (heterotaxia), not an isomerism or pure situs inversus (Table 1B; examples of heterotaxic embryos are shown in Fig. 1). Overall embryonic development (including the dorsoanterior index) and morphogenesis of individual organs was normal, suggesting that ectopic FC signaling has a specific effect on the fundamental orientation or interpretation of LR cues. Microinjection of FC into the egg immediately after fertilization had the same effect (data not shown).

An endogenous FC receptor exists in frog embryos
In view of this dramatic effect of FC on development, we addressed the question of whether an FC-receptor protein, or complex, is present in *Xenopus* embryos. Binding of the radiolabelled 9'-nor-fusicoccin-8′-alcohol probe ([3H]FC) to proteins extracted from stage 5/6 embryos, was compared with binding characteristics of the classical higher plant FC receptor localized to plasma membranes. Intriguingly, unlike in plant cells, the embryonic FC-binding sites were not detected in the microsomal fraction, but instead are cytoplasmic (Fig. 2A). Because non-specific binding of [3H]FC to proteins in the oocyte extract was very low (cf. Fig. 2B), further purification at this stage was not necessary for the binding studies. From the saturation binding curves (shown in Fig. 2A), an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and the total number of receptors (Bmax) can be estimated. The properties of the barley root plasma membrane receptor (KD 1.50±0.11 nM, Bmax 94.7±1.5 pmol.mg-1 protein) are in good agreement with many surveys of plant FC receptors (Abramycheva et al., 1991). The embryo receptor falls into the category of medium-high affinity with a KD of 27.8±6.9 nM and a Bmax of 25.1±3.4 pmol.mg-1 protein.

[PAGE 3] To test whether the radioligand used in the saturation binding experiment, [3H]FC, has the same affinity for the receptor as FC, a competitive binding experiment was carried out with a fixed concentration of [3H]FC and increasing amounts of unlabelled FC (Fig. 2B). For the barley root plasma membrane and embryo cytoplasmic fraction the IC50 values were 1.30±0.12 nM and 660±25 nM, respectively. The values for KD and IC50 are related by the following expression: KD=IC50 - [Radioligand]. Whereas the KD values calculated with these two methods for the plant receptor are in good agreement, the values obtained for the embryo receptor differ by a factor of 24. We conclude that the plant receptor does not differentiate between the [3H]FC probe and unlabelled FC, whereas the embryo receptor is strongly sensitive to the chemical modifications, which were necessary to synthesize [3H]FC from FC. Structure-activity relationships for the plant FC receptor show that FC derivatives usually have lower affinities for the receptor than [3H]FC, except for FC itself (Ballio et al., 1981). Having obtained evidence for an endogenous target of FC signaling in *Xenopus*, we sought to further characterize the mechanism involved (Olsson et al., 1998).

14-3-3-blocking peptide disrupts FC binding *in vitro* and randomizes laterality in embryos
To test the hypothesis that 14-3-3 proteins participate in the formation of the *Xenopus* FC receptor, as they do in plants, we took advantage of one of the 14-3-3 hallmarks: the formation of a tight complex with phosphorylated ligands containing either of the two sequence motifs R[S/Ar]XSPXP or RX[S/Ar]XSPXP, where Ar denotes aromatic residues and SP denotes phosphorylated Ser/Thr (Yaffe et al., 1997). The snug fit of such ligands into the highly conserved amphipathic groove of the 14-3-3 protein specifically and effectively disrupts the interaction between 14-3-3 and partners, *in vivo* as well as *in vitro* (Ballio et al., 1981; Yaffe et al., 1997; Booij et al., 1999; Bunney et al., 2001). We used a phosphopeptide modeled on the phosphorylated hinge 1 region of nitrate reductase (NR), which contains a 'strong' 14-3-3 interaction motif (RSXSPXP) that is also found in many mammalian 14-3-3 partners (e.g. Raf-kinase, Cdc25, PKC and BAD) (Yaffe et al., 1997), and binds to a domain fully conserved in *Xenopus* 14-3-3 proteins (Rittinger et al., 1999; Aitken et al., 2002; Wurtele et al., 2003). Addition of this phosphorylated NR peptide (1 µM) to the FC-binding assay (using 4 nM radioligand) resulted in a 75% reduction in FC-binding to the oocyte receptor as compared with the control (bound [3H]FC was, respectively, 1.010±0.024 and 0.260±0.013 pmol.mg-1 protein). In light of the specificity and effectiveness of this peptide (Bunney et al., 2001), these data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins are essential components of the embryo FC receptor.

[PAGE 4] On the basis of the FC-induced heterotaxia and the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in *in vitro* FC-binding, we formulated the hypothesis that endogenous 14-3-3 proteins are instrumental in correct LR asymmetry. We tested this model by complementing the FC gain-of-function data with a competitive loss-of-function experiment using the same NR-peptide as was utilized in the FC-binding assay. Microinjection of the NR-peptide (which is expected to act as a dominant negative by interfering with FC/14-3-3 complex formation) into embryos at the one-cell stage resulted in a 31% incidence of heterotaxia (Table 2; χ2=58.27, *P*<2.2·10–14). By contrast, injections of a control peptide (which is identical in amino acid sequence, except that the serine in the binding motif is not phosphorylated) did not induce heterotaxia. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 14-3-3 proteins mediate the randomizing effect of FC, and suggest the possibility that 14-3-3 proteins are endogenously involved in the patterning of the LR axis.

14-3-3 protein function is upstream of the left-sided signaling factor XNR1 in the LR pathway
To test the idea that 14-3-3 signaling was involved in LR patterning, we performed an overexpression experiment, reasoning that the regulatory functions of 14-3-3 proteins, especially those that depend on specific spatio-temporal patterns of 14-3-3 function, would be overwhelmed by ubiquitous overexpression. The ability to misexpress individual members of the 14-3-3 family also allowed us to address differential roles for these proteins. The data are summarized in Table 3. Embryos injected with mRNA encoding β-gal exhibited the normal 1% incidence of laterality defects. Embryos injected at the one-cell stage (immediately after embryonic turning) with approximately 300 pg of mRNA encoding the 14-3-3Z subtype exhibited a 6% incidence of heterotaxia. By contrast, one-cell injections of equal amounts of mRNA encoding 14-3-3E protein induced a 30% incidence of heterotaxia. These data are consistent with 14-3-3E proteins, rather than the 14-3-3Z subtype, being involved in the LR pathway.

Interestingly, injections of 14-3-3E mRNA at the two-cell or four-cell stages each resulted in only a 7% incidence of heterotaxia (Table 3). The more than fourfold stronger effect of injections at the one-cell stage compared with injections occurring after the first cleavage (about 1.5 hours later) suggest that 14-3-3E proteins function during very early LR patterning steps. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated whether 14-3-3E activity was upstream of the earliest known asymmetric gene in *Xenopus*: the left-sided signaling factor XNR1 (Lowe et al., 1996; Lohr et al., 1998). Embryos receiving injections of 14-3-3E mRNA at the one-cell stage were fixed at stage 22 and processed for *in situ* hybridization with an XNR1 probe. The results are summarized in Table 4. Control embryos (injected with *lacZ* mRNA) exhibited the correct left-sided expression in 94% of cases (Fig. 3A,B), the remaining 6% showed no expression [a known phenomenon in wild-type unperturbed *Xenopus* embryos (Lohr et al., 1998)]. By contrast, embryos injected with 14-3-3E mRNA exhibited 30% bilateral expression of the left-sided marker (Fig. 3C,D), as well as 12% right-sided expression and 23% absent expression (χ2=50.6, *P*<1.2·10-12). These data show that the randomizing effects of overexpression of 14-3-3 protein act upstream of the earliest known *Xenopus* asymmetric marker.


[PAGE 5] 14-3-3E protein is asymmetrically localized in very early frog embryos
Having determined that alterations of 14-3-3E protein activity can disrupt LR patterning during very early stages of development, we sought to further characterize the endogenous 14-3-3-dependent mechanism by investigating the embryonic expression of members of the *Xenopus* 14-3-3 family. We first examined localization of 14-3-3 protein by immunohistochemistry on sections of embryos (Fig. 4) using well-characterized isoform-specific antibodies (Kumagai et al., 1998). Both 14-3-3E and 14-3-3Z signals were detected, demonstrating that these proteins exist endogenously from the earliest stages of embryonic development in *Xenopus*.
Maternal 14-3-3Z protein was localized throughout the vegetal 75% of the unfertilized egg (Fig. 4A). During the first few cleavages, protein signal was very weak or not detectable (Fig. 4B,C). By gastrulation, zygotic 14-3-3Z protein could be detected in the endodermal yolk mass (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the low effectiveness of 14-3-3Z misexpression in randomizing the LR axis, these localization patterns exhibited no significant LR asymmetries.
The localization of 14-3-3E protein was markedly different from 14-3-3Z (demonstrating lack of cross-over of the two antibodies). Prior to fertilization, 14-3-3E was localized as a fairly tight spot in the center of the egg (Fig. 4E). Strikingly, after the first cleavage, 14-3-3E was localized to only one of the two blastomeres (Fig. 4F). This pattern continues at the second cell cleavage, when dorsoventral (DV) pigment differences allow DV and LR orientation of the embryo, showing that localization is present in the right blastomeres (Fig. 4G). This asymmetric localization of 14-3-3E protein strongly supports the hypothesized endogenous role for 14-3-3E in LR asymmetry, and is the earliest LR-asymmetric molecular localization described in any species to date. By gastrulation, zygotic 14-3-3E is detected in the endodermal yolk mass, in a domain that is more restricted than that of 14-3-3Z.
In light of the asymmetry of 14-3-3E localization in the first two cleavages, we next examined the results of the 14-3-3E overexpression. In embryos that were injected with 14-3-3E mRNA (using the same conditions as in the above experiments that induced subsequent heterotaxia), very high levels of 14-3-3E protein were detected throughout each blastomere during the two- and four-cell stages (Fig. 4I,J). These results confirmed that the injections of 14-3-3E mRNA indeed resulted in high levels of protein that was present ubiquitously, and also served as a cross-check for the fact that the 14-3-3E antibody does recognize 14-3-3E.

Fusicoccin exposure abolishes the asymmetry in 14-3-3E localization
The fact that FC exposure randomizes asymmetry (Table 1) could be due to an alteration of 14-3-3 protein function or localization. We investigated the mechanism underlying the destabilizing effects of FC by examining the localization of 14-3-3E proteins in embryos exposed to levels of FC that cause heterotaxia. Control embryos at the two-cell stage exhibit the asymmetric pattern of 14-3-3E localization (Fig. 5A,B). Interestingly, embryos exposed to FC from fertilization showed bilaterally-symmetrical localization of 14-3-3E (Fig. 5C,D). These data demonstrate that ectopic early FC exposure can abolish the normal asymmetry in 14-3-3E protein localization.


[PAGE 7] 14-3-3 mRNA localization in frog embryos
The embryonic expression of 14-3-3 mRNA has been described in *Xenopus*, but not at early stages (Wu and Muslin, 2002). The asymmetry in 14-3-3E protein localization led us to investigate whether this phenomenon was presaged by similar localization in the mRNA. We used whole-mount *in situ* hybridization to examine localization of maternal and zygotic mRNA for three 14-3-3 genes. At least three different 14-3-3 transcripts are present in early *Xenopus* embryos; representative data are shown in Fig. 6. Maternal mRNA for the 14-3-3T protein (Gawantka et al., 1998) is localized to the cortex of most blastomeres during the first few cleavages (Fig. 6A,B). Zygotic 14-3-3T is expressed in the roof of the blastocoel in blastula *Xenopus* embryos (data not shown), and is later expressed throughout the nervous system, including very strong expression in the head and somites, and a thin border at the caudal end of the embryo, up to the anus (Fig. 6C). Maternal mRNA for 14-3-3Z (Gawantka et al., 1998) is also located in the cortex of cleaving blastomeres in the first two cell cleavages (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, at the 16- and 32-cell stages, it is located in the animal half of vegetal cells (Fig. 6E), and in some blastomeres exhibits an unusual horseshoe pattern (Fig. 6F). No left-right asymmetries were detected. By contrast, 14-3-3E mRNA exhibits an asymmetry at the first cell cleavage consistent with that seen in 14-3-3E proteins (Fig. 6G,H). We confirmed this pattern by sectioning (Fig. 6I,J). These data illustrate that 14-3-3 mRNAs are subject to localization events resulting in spatially-complex geometric patterns.
