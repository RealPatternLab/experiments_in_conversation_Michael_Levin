[PAGE 2] SUMMARY

Spatiotemporal patterns of cellular resting potential regulate several aspects of development. One key aspect of the bioelectric code is that transcriptional and morphogenetic states are determined not by local, single-cell, voltage levels but by specific distributions of voltage across cell sheets. We constructed and analyzed a minimal dynamical model of collective gene expression in cells based on inputs of multicellular voltage patterns. Causal integration analysis revealed a higher-order mechanism by which information about the voltage pattern was spatiotemporally integrated into gene activity, as well as a division of labor among and between the bioelectric and genetic components. We tested and confirmed predictions of this model in a system in which bioelectric control of morphogenesis regulates gene expression and organogenesis: the embryonic brain of the frog *Xenopus laevis*. This study demonstrates that machine learning and computational integration approaches can advance our understanding of the information-processing underlying morphogenetic decision-making, with a potential for other applications in developmental biology and regenerative medicine.

[PAGE 2] INTRODUCTION

Embryonic development is a remarkable process, in which a large number of cells cooperate toward invariant large-scale anatomical shapes.<sup>1,2</sup> Central to this phenomenon (in most organisms) is long-range order: not only local identity for each cell in a hardwired mosaic but high levels of tolerance to noise, ability to handle perturbations, and active cell-cell interactions that maintain growth and form.<sup>1,3,4</sup> Robust mechanisms ensure that overall proportions among organs, symmetry, and topological and geometrical relationships are maintained across the whole organism.<sup>5-8</sup> Of particular interest are the context-sensitive responses that enable transcriptional events based on large-scale (non-cell-autonomous) information that signals completion of morphogenetic processes or errors in tissue-level order.<sup>2,9</sup> However, while cell-level mechanisms linking signals to cell fate are beginning to be well understood, the rate-limiting step for many approaches in regenerative medicine and morphogenic bioengineering is gaining control over tissue- and organ-level collective dynamics.

Morphogenesis is orchestrated by several physical modalities that enable cells to coordinate their actions toward specific anatomical outcomes. In addition to biochemical gradients<sup>10-15</sup> and biomechanical forces,<sup>16-18</sup> it is now evident that bioelectric networks<sup>19-21</sup> (spatiotemporal patterns of membrane voltage across cell fields) produce spatial gradient information that is instructive for growth and form in a number of well-studied contexts. For example, endogenous bioelectric prepatterns have been functionally implicated in the location and size of organs such as the eye,<sup>22</sup> invertebrate wing,<sup>23-26</sup> vertebrate appendage,<sup>27-29</sup> and face.<sup>29-31</sup> Bioelectric prepatterns also polarize the left-right<sup>32-35</sup> and dorsoventral<sup>36,37</sup> axes and are involved in size control,<sup>38-42</sup> embryonic compartmentalization,<sup>43-47</sup> and stem cell function.<sup>48-50</sup> Transduction mechanisms for bioelectric signals,<sup>51</sup> downstream transcriptional machinery,<sup>52</sup> and interfaces between electrical and mechanical events<sup>53,54</sup> have begun to be characterized. The key role of bioelectric signals and their potential as therapeutic targets is underscored by computational models that have now come online,<sup>55-60</sup> which enable rational manipulation of ion channel interfaces (via drugs, light, or mRNA misexpression) to induce ectopic organ formation,<sup>22,61</sup> trigger complex regenerative response,<sup>62-64</sup> and reverse tumorigenesis<sup>65,66</sup> in model systems *in vivo*. Some of these modulators are beginning to be applied to human medicine as electroceuticals.<sup>67-76</sup>

A number of mechanisms for converting membrane voltage changes in an individual cell into changes in that cell's behaviors have been characterized as cell-autonomous transduction mechanisms.<sup>51</sup> However, it remains unclear how tissue-level bioelectric information (distribution of cell resting potentials across cell fields) is processed to achieve large-scale morphological outcomes. For example, specific distributions of membrane voltage pattern across cells indicate the location, size, and organ identity of hearts, eyes, wings, and other structures.<sup>22-24,77-79</sup> This requires downstream transcriptional cascades to be triggered by specific multicellular patterns of voltage, as has been shown for Sox2, Pax6, MSX-1, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and BMP,<sup>64,80,81</sup> as well as a range of other transcripts identified in transcriptomic analyses of voltage-modified tissues.<sup>52</sup> Because complex organogenesis and regeneration cannot be solved by purely local information at the single-cell level, it is essential to understand how the regional spatial pattern of voltages across a group of cells is converted into the diverse patterns of gene expression required for normal morphology.<sup>1,9</sup> Thus, models of developmental bioelectricity must move to considering the more complex and interesting systems-level question of how a collective of cells processes the information encoded in bioelectrical patterns across distance to orchestrate a differentiated pattern of transcriptional responses.<sup>57,59,82,83</sup>

[PAGE 3] The relationships between multicellular bioelectric patterns and downstream transcriptional cascades are not easily intuited, and the parameter space for experimentally testing all possibilities is vast. Especially, there is a need for rigorous models that show how composite transcriptional-bioelectric circuits can recognize correct and incorrect patterns during regulative development; generative models of this type serve as crucial hypotheses about the dynamics that are sufficient to perform the task and can make testable predictions. We therefore developed a framework in which machine learning could be deployed to search for empirically testable, minimal, predictive models that integrate simplified bioelectric pattern and transcriptional changes (Figures 1 and 2). We then applied this methodology to the specific instance of modeling bioelectric control of *Xenopus* embryonic brain development,<sup>84-86</sup> where such a relation between bioelectric pattern and transcriptional changes has been experimentally identified.<sup>80,87,88</sup>

Previous modeling work in this area includes multicellular genetic networks that either do not comprise any bioelectric components,<sup>89,90</sup> are highly detailed multicellular bioelectric-gene networks containing several biophysical components that render them too computationally complex for using machine learning for parameter space exploration,<sup>56</sup> or are simple bioelectric-gene networks possessing only one gene per cell.<sup>91</sup> Moreover, prior work on predictive modeling did not analyze the information-processing dynamics that the models employ to map voltage patterns to transcriptional patterns—an issue more broadly relevant to the evolution of patterning mechanisms. Here, we adopted a bioelectric-genetic network modeling approach that shows the minimal mechanisms and relationships sufficient to accomplish a specific morphogenetic task. Our bioelectric networks are modeled with just two generic ion channels, whereas the genetic networks comprise several genes and intercellular and intracellular interconnections (Figures 1F and 2A). Importantly, this enabled us to analyze the information-processing mechanisms that bridge the dynamical gap between bioelectric patterns into collective gene expression.

We considered the nascent *Xenopus laevis* brain, because it is a complex organ commonly used to model disorders with biomedical relevance<sup>84,85,92-96</sup> and because its normal morphogenesis has already been shown to include a bioelectric component.<sup>22,80,97,98</sup> In this system, a complex interplay between secreted factors, morphogens, and transcription factors leads to neural induction and formation of the neural plate.<sup>15</sup> Briefly, secreted proteins from the mesoderm block the action of morphogens (particularly BMPs and Wnts) in the adjacent ectodermal cells. Blocking of BMPs and Wnts along with FGF activation leads to the induction of neural transcription factors (such as Fox, Sox, Zic, and Irx families) that make these ectodermal cells refractory to morphogens and drive neural induction and neural plate formation.<sup>12,15,99-104</sup> For the bioelectric pattern, beginning at embryonic stage 16, a dramatic contrast develops between the transmembrane voltage potential at the neural plate (hyperpolarized) and in the surrounding ectoderm (depolarized), establishing a bioelectric pre-pattern that regulates subsequent large-scale brain development<sup>80,97</sup> (Figures 1A and 1B). Crucially, it is the long-range difference between voltage in these regions that is required for normal development, not the absolute values of specific regions. This bioelectric contrast pattern regulates expression of canonical brain development transcription factors (e.g., Notch, Otx2, Pax6, Emx, Xbf1/Foxg1, Sox2) as well as neural progenitor cell proliferation and apoptosis, driving normal development of the brain<sup>80,87,97</sup> (Figures 1A and 1B). Disrupting this normal bioelectric contrast pattern disrupts the differential

[PAGE 4] RESULTS

Machine learning discovered a model that solves the voltage pattern recognition problem

To elucidate the conditions sufficient to solve the pattern discrimination problem, we chose a single high-performing model for subsequent analysis and examined the evolution of its ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect voltage patterns (see Methods). The connectivity and associated parameters of the chosen model are depicted in Figure 3, which shows a simplified two-cell version of the full model (Tables S1-S8). The lines connecting the two cells comprise about 20% of the strongest connections: 10% of the most positive and 10% of the most negative. The strongest connections (thick edges in the figure) are (1) those that run from the voltage to a few genes, providing reliable transmission of information about the input voltage to the genes and (2) those connecting a small subset of genes both within a cell and between cells. These observations translate into differences in timescales of voltage and gene expression dynamics; here, voltage changes occur at a relatively slower rate compared with gene expression (Figure S14). This makes sense in light of the fact that the voltage pattern serves as the input, whereas gene expression is the output: for the input to be reliably translated into the output, it should change relatively slowly,<sup>119,120</sup> despite the recurrent connectivity between them. This also reflects biological observations, as non-neural embryonic bioelectric signals happen on the timescale of several hours (neural plate bioelectric pattern happens from stage 15 to stage 18<sup>80,121</sup>), which is slower than the regulation of many genes. We next analyze in detail the behavior and dynamics of this model.

On average, genes in the model successfully discriminate between the correct and incorrect voltage patterns: when averaged over all cells and all genes, expression is increased for the correct voltage pattern and decreased for the incorrect pattern (Figure 4A). The average magnitudes of expression are relatively low, about +0.5 for activation and -0.2 for repression, compared with the ideal values of +1.0 and -1.0 respectively. These magnitudes yield a performance score of 0.64, significantly higher than the 0.5 score expected for a randomly parameterized model; for comparison, the minimum observed score was 0.5 and the 95th percentile score was about 0.58 (Figure S1). Importantly, the average changes in gene expression in response to the correct and incorrect voltage patterns clearly diverge over time. When we look at individual genes, this separation is largest for gene 6, as indicated by the corresponding discrimination score (Figure 4A; bottom right inset). For this reason, we term gene 6 the "discriminator gene" and focus on its behavior in the analyses below.

Interestingly, the temporal dynamics of the voltage pattern in this model also recapitulate the temporal evolution of the bioelectric pattern *in vivo* during development even though the model was not specifically trained to develop it (solid black lines in Figure 4B). At the beginning, our model exhibits a flat depolarized pattern across all cells; then, fairly early in the simulation, the cells in the center (modeling the neural plate) hyperpolarize to produce the characteristic voltage contrast seen *in vivo*, before reverting to the flat depolarized pattern about halfway through the simulation. This corresponds to what we see in this region between developmental stages 14 and 20 *in vivo*.<sup>80</sup> These observations suggested that even though the quantitative performance of the model is not ideal, its quality warranted further analysis.


[PAGE 5] Although the bioelectric pattern that regulates brain morphology in this system is known, it is not understood how these multicellular patterns could be collectively interpreted and executed across the field of cells in the neural plate and the surrounding ectoderm. Here, we sought to answer a general question: how are such multicellular tissue-level bioelectric patterns converted into specific genetic expression patterns in cells, leading to correct large-scale brain morphology? This is a question that affects numerous contexts in addition to the frog brain (reviewed in<sup>107</sup>), and our model is focused on that part of the process: from large-scale bioelectric pattern to a transcriptional output (Figures 1F and 1G). This approach does not depend on the specific identity of the responding genes or their relationship to other downstream genes, but our model is consistent with the known molecular details of neural tube patterning in frog.

Our goal is to take the first step toward exploring the high-level information-processing aspects of how multicellular bioelectric patterns could lead to specific gene expression changes in cells that then lead to large-scale morphogenesis. Our model is developed in the context of experimental observations in *Xenopus* embryonic development that changes in bioelectric pattern spread across the neural plate result in specific changes in neural patterning transcription factor genes such as Otx2, Pax6, Foxg1, Emx1, Sox2, and Notch. We are not seeking to simulate exact molecular level details (which is impossible, given the current state of knowledge) but to reveal generic, yet sufficiently bio-realistic, dynamics that could account for this phenomenon in a range of contexts. Therefore, we adopted a modeling approach that combines the predictive power of generic artificial neural networks and the explanatory power of specific biophysical models. In this model, the inputs (bioelectric patterns) are mapped to the outputs (gene expression patterns representing overt brain development outcomes) via generic mechanisms designed by machine learning; specific biological features are also incorporated as model constraints (Figures 1F and 2A). This modeling strategy is inspired by the so-called biologically informed and physics-informed neural networks,<sup>108,109</sup> which are conventional artificial neural networks subject to additional physical and biological constraints. As we sought to understand the interplay between the bioelectrical and gene-regulatory variables, our model assumes simplified bioelectric and gene regulatory mechanisms and their interactions in a static fixed network (cell division and migration are not explicitly modeled). The model also assumes generic features that embryos generally share, such as topographic and symmetrical intercellular connectivity, a common gene regulatory network that all cells share, etc.

We adopted an approach that is intermediate between "forward" and "reverse" modeling—by starting from known biological features (Table 1) and leaving the unknown properties to automatic reverse engineering.<sup>110,111</sup> While the overall transcriptional outcomes of correct and incorrect bioelectrical patterns in the neural plate have been characterized,<sup>88,97,105,112</sup> detailed information about the regulatory networks comprising relevant genes and the regulatory connections between voltage and gene expression is limited, if any.<sup>113-116</sup> Thus, we sought to analyze a minimal, yet biologically realistic, model that would reveal the dynamics sufficient to observe the known phenomena of biophysical genetic regulation of outcomes in the nascent tadpole brain. Adopting a hybrid approach also enabled us to leverage the benefits of both by facilitating the exploration of high-level information-processing mechanisms afforded by the forward approach as well as specific quantitative predictions enabled by the reverse approach.<sup>110</sup>

As a first step to address the question of how subsequent gene expression of cells distinguishes correct versus incorrect voltage distributions across cell fields, we elucidated the information-processing mechanism relating the bioelectric and gene expression patterns of a high-performing model that machine learning discovered (Figure 2B) from among a suite of 40 initially randomly parameterized models. We focused our analysis on a single model, as we sought to demonstrate and analyze an example of sufficient design principles rather than a broad study of necessary conditions. While no model can formally prove particular mechanisms to be the cause of empirical observations, models that show dynamics sufficient<sup>117</sup> to reproduce the dynamics observed in a biological system are essential to begin the continuous dialogue between modeling and experimentation that leads to improved functional understanding and control of complex system-level biology.<sup>111,117</sup> Our model was formulated with the goal of continued improvement, as specific data come in from future testing of its implications.

Our analysis shows that the mechanism instantiated in our class of models not only exhibits invariance to the scale of the modeled tissue but also a simplified higher-order spatiotemporal information integration mechanism that maps the spatial bioelectric pattern to the gene expression pattern. The tissue exhibited functional specialization, with cells at the voltage inflection points of the bioelectric pattern being important for correct pattern recognition and collective cellular decision-making. The genes within the individual cells were responsive to the voltages of faraway cells over longer periods of time, indicating their roles in integrating information across the tissue. This character further manifested as a division of labor among the genes in regard to their differential sensitivities to the various spatial scales of the bioelectric pattern. Our analysis led to predictions concerning the previously unknown role of the polarization ratio of the tissue in the determination


[PAGE 7] Emergent scaling of the chosen model: The pattern discrimination problem was solved in larger tissues despite lack of explicit selection for such capability

One central aspect of biological control mechanisms is that they often have properties that were not specifically selected for, by virtue of generic (inherent) properties of networks.<sup>8,122,123</sup> We were interested in uncovering any novel emergent features in our model, focusing especially on size control. The ability to establish correct overall pattern despite differences in tissue size or available cell number,<sup>124-128</sup> a key competency of developmental and regenerative morphogenesis, is still poorly understood in models based on reaction-diffusion networks<sup>56,129,130</sup> due to their limited scaling robustness.

Interestingly, our model successfully solved the pattern discrimination problem even in a larger tissue containing 180 cells (compared with the original 24 cells), even though it was not specifically trained for that purpose (Figure 5). In other words, the qualitative behavior of the discriminator gene is preserved, where the activity in the flanking columns is relatively lower compared with the columns closer to the center in both models, suggesting that the dynamics of the original model have scaled up (Figure S3A). The model was found to scale to tissues as large as about 400 cells but the quality of scaling drops for much larger tissues where the genes in the flanking columns deactivate since information about the pattern does not propagate to the margins of the tissue in time (Figure S3B). The *Xenopus* neural plate can be roughly estimated to contain 43 x 43 cells. Thus, the bioelectric pattern which contains neural plate cells and surrounding ectoderm cells can be estimated to be ~83 cells wide,<sup>131,132</sup> which is squarely within the scaling range of our model. This suggests that the pattern can scale in a similar manner to a tissue that is larger or smaller than the *Xenopus* neural plate tissue, within certain limits.


[PAGE 7] High-level information-processing mechanisms employed to solve the pattern discrimination problem

We next performed a detailed analysis of the model to decipher some of the high-level information-processing mechanisms and organizational principles it employs to solve the pattern discrimination problem. In the following, we specifically asked the following: (1) Does functional specialization exist among the components (cells, genes, modules, etc.)? (2) Does a division of labor exist in terms of the scales (distributed or local) at which information-processing is performed? (3) Are there high-level relationships among the components that facilitate pattern discrimination? (4) How is the voltage pattern processed in the tissue? All of these are precursors to a mature understanding of collective, multimodal patterning mechanisms necessary for progress in basic evolutionary developmental biology and regenerative medicine and morphogenetic engineering.

[PAGE 7] Cells surrounding voltage pattern transition points are more important than other cells

To determine whether different cells in the tissue play different roles in the collective recognition of the endogenous voltage pattern, we performed an *in silico* cell "knockout" analysis. Specific cells were frozen by clamping the states of the corresponding genes at zero and dropping their biases to negative infinity, thereby rendering them ineffectual both as input and output, and the performance of the model was then computed.


[PAGE 8] Knocking out the cells surrounding the voltage transition points of the endogenous pattern—at the boundaries of the central band where there are large changes in the spatial profile of the voltage pattern—resulted in a greater drop in performance (Figure 6). In other words, cells closer to the voltage transition points are more important in recognizing the pattern compared with the cells further away. Specifically, the four cells at the center of the 4x6 tissue are the most significant contributors to performance (Figure 6A). By virtue of scale robustness, this property also extends to the larger 10x18 tissue where small 2x3 patches of cells were knocked out. There again, the cells flanking the center of the tissue are the most important (Figure 6B). Although there are slight differences between the smaller and the larger tissues with regard to the exact spatial regions that are most important, the general principle holds: cells coinciding with changes in the pattern contribute more to its discrimination. A potential explanation for these observations is that the voltage transition points comprise the only difference between the endogenous pattern and the uniform patterns, suggesting that this strategy may computationally optimal.

[PAGE 8] A simplified higher-order control mechanism characterizes the relationship between the endogenous voltage pattern and gene expression

To characterize the high-level relationships between the endogenous voltage pattern and tissue-level gene expression, we attempted to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of the discriminator gene in terms of its dynamic sensitivities to voltage patterns captured in the Jacobian and Hessian tensors (Figure 7; Equations 3 and 4); reconstruction of the activities of the other genes are shown in Figure S9. Due to the 4-fold reflection symmetry of the 2D lattice-structured tissue (Figure 1F), we computed the sum of sensitivities of the discriminator gene, corresponding to the endogenous input pattern, only for the cells in the top left quadrant of the tissue (mathematical details in the figure caption). The extent to which these quantities can reconstruct the dynamic timeseries of gene expression reflects the amount of control that voltage exerts over gene expression.

We found that the dynamic profile of the discriminator gene expression corresponding to the endogenous input pattern could be almost fully recovered with just the Hessian (Figure 7), with a match significantly higher than random expectation (Figure S8). On the other hand, the Jacobian alone produced a reconstruction with a lower quality of match that was not significantly different from random expectation (Figure S8). Taken together, these observations suggest that the voltage pattern exerts control over the discriminator gene expression almost exclusively at the second-order level. In other words, it is the voltages of pairs of cells, rather than of single cells, that influence gene expression. A possible explanation is that pattern discrimination requires a comparison of voltage of different cells, which the Hessian presumably aids by containing the differential information. The aforementioned observations also suggest that the voltage pattern

The timeseries shows the mean expression, averaged over all cells, of the discriminator gene in a scaled up 10x18 model, initialized with the endogenous voltage pattern (inset; left and right six columns are depolarized, and the middle six columns are hyperpolarized), showing that it successfully discriminates between the correct and incorrect voltage patterns. More detailed timeseries resolved at the cell of the level and for larger tissues are presented in Figure S3.

controls tissue-level gene expression in an effectively feedforward manner (a simple analog of this is shown in Figure S6 and analyzed in Figure S7) despite the complex recurrent connectivity between them (Figure 4; also demonstrated by the fact that severing the feedback connections from the genes to the voltage partially affects the pattern discrimination ability of the model, as shown in Figure S12). In other words, the bioelectric pattern exerts a "canalized" control over the discriminator gene's expression by effectively linearizing the complex nonlinearity of the network—an observation that cannot be discerned from an inspection of the static connectivity of the tissue (Figure 3) alone.

[PAGE 9] Long-distance influence and spatiotemporal integration characterizes bioelectric control

To further characterize the information-processing mechanisms underlying the bioelectric control of tissue-level gene expression, we analyzed the spatiotemporal organization of Hessian networks (Figure 8, Methods subsection "causal integration analysis") underlying the discriminator gene expression timeseries shown in Figure 7 that was reconstructed using approximation methods (Equations 3 and 4). In the context of the embryo, a Hessian network represents the extent of changes in gene expression following small perturbations in the voltages of a pair of cells after a time interval spanning a length of *T*. Thus, the Hessian networks are dynamic in nature since the causal influence among the cells changes over time; in contrast, the underlying apparent tissue connectivity (Figure 1F) is static in nature. We found that the Hessian networks are characterized by symmetry breaking and long-distance influence. Furthermore, the resemblance between them and the original network declines over time during the simulation, as evidenced by the fact that the locality of the influencing cell is broken, despite the symmetric and topographic nature of the underlying connectivity. This is due to the fact that the influences are dynamic and oscillatory in that they start out locally during the early time points (*t* = 5), then switch to the other bands (*t* = 50-410) and then back to being more local (*t* = 495). During this process, the signs of the influence also change. For example, the influence exerted by all the bands tends to be mostly negative up until *t* = 125, but around *t* = 200 they exert differential influence, in that the middle band continues to exert negative influence, whereas the marginal bands switch to a positive influence. This time point also roughly happens to be the decision-making point where the gene expressions diverge for the correct and the incorrect input patterns (Figure 4A). Overall, the oscillatory scanning-like behavior of the influence suggests that information is integrated both over space and time before a decision is made—a hypothesis that is further supported by the observation that a similar mechanism is exhibited by the Jacobian as well (Figure S10). A possible explanation is that since the genes in a cell have immediate access only to the cell's own voltage, it would need to integrate the voltage information from across the tissue before the tissue as a whole detects the class of the input pattern and makes a collective decision.

[PAGE 9] Division of labor: Different genes are attuned to different spatial scales of the tissue

We next analyzed the scales of sensitivity of each gene by computing the difference between the Jacobian (first-order) sensitivity to the whole tissue and that of the single cell that contains it, averaged over the cells in the top left quadrant of the tissue (Figure 9;

[PAGE 10] Figure 6. Differential change in model performance due to knocking out individual or patches of cells in the tissue

The darker the shade of a block, the higher the drop in performance due to knocking out that block. A cell or a patch was "knocked out" by freezing the states of its corresponding genes at zero and dropping their biases to negative infinity, thereby rendering them ineffectual both as inputs and outputs.

mathematical details in figure caption). We found that there is a unique apportioning of the gene sensitivities among the various spatial scales of the voltage pattern: some genes (2 and 5) are more attuned to the pattern at the tissue level, some (genes 3 and 4) to the single-cell level, and others (genes 1 and 6) display a fine balance between the two scales. This distribution of labor suggests that different genes play different functional roles tied to their respective spatial sensitivities. Indeed, we found that knocking out genes 2 or 5 affected detection of the non-endogenous uniform patterns but not the detection of the endogenous voltage pattern, whereas knocking out genes 4 or 6 affected detection of the latter (Figure S11). This implies that genes 2 and 5 are specialized for the homogeneous (incorrect) patterns, whereas genes 4 and 6 are specialized for the heterogeneous patterns. A possible explanation that ties these observations to the genes' spatial sensitivity scales is that detection of homogeneity requires a tissue-level sensitivity, but heterogeneity requires a relatively smaller scale of sensitivity in this model. It appears that genes 2 and 5 sense whether the voltages across all cells in tissue are equal, whereas the other genes are sensing local differences in voltages. The tissue is deemed heterogeneous if a local patch is heterogeneous, whereas the tissue is homogeneous only if all local patches are homogeneous, hence the differences in the corresponding scales of sensitivities.

[PAGE 10] Model predicts preservation or partial disruption of outcome in response to non-endogenous voltage patterns with altered polarization ratios

We already know that incorrect voltage patterns can disrupt gene expression and morphogenesis *in vivo*.<sup>30,31,80,87,88</sup> For example, manipulating ion channels to produce a uniformly hyperpolarized pattern in this region altered forebrain markers gene expression and resulted in stage 45 tadpoles with deformed forebrain, midbrain, and eyes (Figures 2 and 3 from ref.<sup>80</sup>). Hence, we next asked whether our model can provide insight into the robustness of this system: which changes in the voltage pattern do and do not interfere with correct brain morphological patterning? To that end we sought to test predictions suggested by our analysis of the model's information-processing mechanisms.

The analyses in the previous section suggest that an asymmetric context dependency exists among the cells: the extent to which the voltage of a cell influences the gene expression in other cells depends on the type of polarization of the other cells. Specifically, there is a greater dependency on depolarized cells compared with hyperpolarized cells, on average, as seen in Figure 8 and quantified in Figure S5. In other words, depolarized cells exert a greater influence than hyperpolarized cells on the gene expression of other cells regardless of their polarization. This suggests that the proportion of depolarized to hyperpolarized cells in the tissue may be one of the factors that determines how the voltage pattern is processed. Consequently, we tested two types of modified endogenous patterns: a "half-and-half" pattern and a "sharpened" pattern. In the half-and-half pattern, one-half of the tissue is hyperpolarized and the other half is depolarized (in essence a step function pattern), whereas in the sharpened pattern the overall voltage pattern is maintained but fewer cells in the central band are hyperpolarized compared with the normal pattern.

The gene activity in response to the half-and-half pattern was similar to that of the endogenous pattern on average, with a mean asymptotic activity of about 0.7 and 0.9 for the endogenous pattern and a mean overall activity of 0.5 in both cases, thereby predicting either a normal brain morphology or one with very minor defects (Figure 10A). On the other hand, the gene activity in response to the sharpened pattern was lower on average, with a mean asymptotic activity of about 0.4 as compared with 0.9 for the endogenous pattern and mean overall activities of about 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, thereby predicting a brain morphology with minor or substantive defects (Figure 10B). A more nuanced analysis is presented in Figures S4 and S14. We next tested these predictions *in vivo*.


[PAGE 11] Figure 7. Analytical reconstruction of the gene expression timeseries using only the second-order influence of the voltage pattern on gene expression

A comparison between the normalized original expression timeseries of the discriminator gene (dashed) for the endogenous input pattern and the corresponding reconstruction (solid) obtained from the second-order (Hessian) influence of the endogenous voltage pattern reveals their similarity. The timeseries was reconstructed using the equation g<sub>6</sub>(*t*+1) = g<sub>6</sub>(*t*) + ΣΣ<sub>*j*∈TL</sub> C<sub>H</sub><sup>[6]</sup>(∂<sup>2</sup>g<sub>6,*j*</sub>(*t*)/∂G<sub>p*l*</sub>∂G<sub>p*k*</sub>)(0), where TL refers to the set of cells in the top left quadrant of the tissue and C<sub>H</sub> was optimized to fit the observed normalized {g<sub>6</sub>(*t*)} with the initial condition g<sub>6</sub>(0) = 0. Only the cells in the 2x3 top left quadrant of the full 4x6 tissue (dashed boxes) were considered because the model is bilaterally symmetrical both about the vertical and horizontal axes.

[PAGE 11] Empirical testing of prediction one: Altering the voltage pattern regulating brain development in only one-half of *Xenopus* embryo does not disrupt endogenous brain development

Our previous work showed that disrupting the normal membrane voltage pattern in the neural plate and surrounding ectoderm resulted in significant abnormalities in large-scale brain morphology and function<sup>80,87,88,97,105,106</sup> (Figures 1C and 1D). Hence our model's first prediction (Figure 10A) that inducing an abnormal step function bioelectric pattern will either not disrupt normal brain development or cause minor (likely undetectable) defects, was surprising. To test this prediction, we used a well-established strategy for altering voltage patterns in *Xenopus* embryos by overexpressing ion channels via mRNA microinjection.<sup>33,42,80,87,88,105,133,134</sup> Ion channel mRNA was titrated to the lowest levels that produced phenotypes. As in our previous studies, there were no signs of general toxicity, ill health, or off-target effects (midline patterning, overall growth rate, scale proportions, and behavior were normal<sup>135,136</sup>).

The neural plate and surrounding ectoderm are largely derived from the two dorsal blastomeres of the four-celled *Xenopus* embryo<sup>137</sup> (Figure 11A). To convert the endogenous voltage contrast pattern to a step function pattern, we co-microinjected Kv1.5 (a voltage-gated potassium channel that hyperpolarizes<sup>138</sup>) with lineage-tracer β-galactosidase mRNA into a single dorsal blastomere (Figures 11A-11C). Uninjected embryos and embryos injected only with β-galactosidase mRNA served as controls. Imaging of ~stage 15 embryos using voltage reporter dyes confirmed that Kv1.5 + β-galactosidase mRNA microinjection hyperpolarized only the injected half of the neural plate and surrounding ectoderm, changing the normal V-shaped voltage pattern seen in control embryos to a step function pattern (Figures 11B and 11C). We then evaluated brain morphology and confirmed our microinjection tissue targeting at stage 45. Our perturbations were specifically targeted to central nervous tissue (brain, eye, and spinal cord) as confirmed by specific localization of β-galactosidase lineage label in these tissues (Figure 11G), and we did not observe any extraneous morphological defects outside CNS in the injected tadpoles. At stage 45, control tadpoles showed normal brain patterning<sup>85</sup> (Figures 11D and 11H). Surprisingly, as predicted by the model, the Kv1.5 + β-galactosidase mRNA-injected tadpoles also exhibited normal brain patterning (Figures 11E and 11H). To demonstrate that this counter-expectation result is not specific to Kv1.5 channels but is due to the altered voltage pattern, we repeated the experiment with a different channel, Kir4.1, which is also known to hyperpolarize cells.<sup>35,139</sup> Microinjecting Kir4.1 mRNA in the same protocol also resulted in stage 45 tadpoles with normal eye and brain patterning (Figure 11H).
