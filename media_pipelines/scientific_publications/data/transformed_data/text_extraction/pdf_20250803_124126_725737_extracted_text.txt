Abstract
Recent developments in the study of topological defects highlight the importance of understanding the multi-dimensional structure of bulk excitations inside a quantum system. When the bulk ground state is trivial, i.e. a product state, excitations on top of it are decoupled from each other and correspond to lower-dimensional phases and their defects within. In this paper, we expand the discussion to invertible phases and study the bulk excitations in, for example, SPT phases, majorana chains, p + ip superconductors etc. We find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between bulk excitations inside a nontrivial invertible phase and those in a product state. For SPT phases, this can be shown using the symmetric Quantum Cellular Automaton that maps from the product state to the SPT state. More generally, for invertible phases realizable using the Topological Holography construction, we demonstrate the correspondence using the fact that certain gapped boundary conditions of a topological bulk state have only relative distinctions but no absolute ones.

[PAGE 2] INTRODUCTION
In noninteracting systems, particle excitations carry the full information about the bulk spectrum. In interacting systems, sometimes a quasi-particle picture also works well (Fermi-liquids, fractional Quantum Hall states, for example). But there are also cases where higher-dimensional excitations are of fundamental importance. Examples include the Ising ferromagnetic phase in 2 + 1D and discrete gauge theories in 3 + 1D. In the ferromagnet, the basic form of excitation is the magnetic domain walls, which form loops. Flux loops in gauge theories, on the other hand, underlie the ground state degeneracy on nontrivial manifolds and have nontrivial braiding statistics with the point charge excitation. To properly understand the excitation spectrum in these systems and other strongly interacting systems in general, it is important to consider higher-dimensional excitations as well.

Let us start from the simplest case: a trivially gapped D-dimensional bulk state.<sup>1</sup> This can be an atomic insulator or a polarized spin state whose ground state wave function can be continuously connected to a product state. Usually we think about point excitations above such a state - electrons in a higher orbital in the atomic insulator or a spin flip in the polarized spin state - and the waves formed by such point excitations. But there are also line excitations and even surface excitations. In a product-state bulk, such d-dimensional excitations are unentangled from the bulk and from other excitations, and they form their own state. The collection of d-dimensional excitations in a product state bulk hence has the same structure as d dimensional quantum systems. But d-dimensional excitations can come in different types and shapes. What are the interesting ones that we want to consider and how to formulate their structure? For the product-state bulk, since
<sup>1</sup>In the following discussion, we use D to denote the dimension of the bulk system and use d to denote the dimension of the excitations. d < D.

[PAGE 3]
the d-dimensional excitations correspond to d-dimensional quantum states, one choice is to focus on those that correspond to the ground states of d-dimensional gapped phases. One way to understand gapped phases is with quantum circuits [1]. This picture can be summarized as follows: States within the same gapped phase are connected through finite depth circuits while states in different phases are connected through sequential quantum circuits. A sequential quantum circuit is a kind of circuit that preserves the entanglement area law [2]. According to this definition, gapped states generated from a product state with a finite depth circuit belong to the trivial phase. With this equivalence relation, gapped quantum states fall into discrete gapped phases and the study of the structure of d-dimensional excitations above the product-state bulk now becomes the study of the structure of d-dimensional gapped phases.

For non-product bulk states, excitations within are coupled to the bulk and hence have different structures. A similar criterion can be set up to study d-dimensional excitations above a bulk state in general:

1. We will focus on d-dimensional excitations that are gapped ground states of a modified Hamiltonian with Hamiltonian terms differing from the bulk only along the excitation.
2. If two d-dimensional excitations can be mapped into each other through a d-dimensional finite-depth circuit, then the two are equivalent excitations.
3. d-dimensional excitations generated from the bulk ground state with a d-dimensional finite-depth circuit are of the trivial type.
4. Nontrivial types of d-dimensional excitation cannot be generated from the bulk with a d-dimensional finite-depth quantum circuit. They are generated with either a d + 1-dimensional circuit or a d-dimensional sequential circuit.

This set of criteria is a natural generalization of the notion of 'super-selection sector' for quasi-particle excitations. Equivalence relations between quasi-particle excitations are given by 0-dimensional finite depth circuits - that is, local unitary transformations. Nontrivial types of quasiparticle excitations have to be generated with a 'string operator' - a 1-dimensional finite-depth circuit or sequential circuit. While we do not usually think of quasi-particles as ground states of a modified Hamiltonian, we can. We can modify the Hamiltonian so that it traps a quasi-particle excitation at a particular location. In fact, when we talk about the ‘degeneracy' of nonabelian anyons, it is with respect to this modified Hamiltonian not the original bulk Hamiltonian. In higher dimensions, this set of criteria covers the situations mentioned above: domain walls in 2 + 1D ferromagnets and flux loops in 3 + 1D gauge theories.

We can use the above criterion recursively to establish a 'higher-category' structure of excitations which highlights the fact that not only do excitations come in different dimensions, but excitations from different dimensions are inherently interconnected with each other [3-6]. As shown in Figure 1, on top of the d-dimensional excitations, we can consider d - 1-dimensional excitations which are the gapped ground state of a Hamiltonian modified further along a d - 1-dimensional submanifold within the d-dimensional excitation. The equivalence relation among the d – 1-dimensional excitations are given by d– 1-dimensional finite depth circuits.<sup>2</sup> Then on top of the d - 1 dimensional excitations (on top of a d-dimensional excitation), we can further consider d-2-dimensional excitations with equivalence relation given by d - 2 dimensional finite depth circuits and so on. In the category language, the d-dimensional excitations are called 'objects', the d - 1-dimensional excitations on top are called 'morphisms', and the d - 2-dimensional excitations are called 'morphisms of morphisms', etc. Given the set of excitations, we can further talk about the fusion among them. Fusion between a pair of k-dimensional excitations is given by a k-dimensional finite depth circuit that maps the pair of excitations to their fusion result (another k-dimensional excitation). For example, we can study the fusion of two d-dimensional excitations, the fusion of two d - 1-dimensional excitations on top of a d-dimensional excitation, and the fusion of two d-dimensional excitations with d - 1-dimensional excitations on top, as shown in Figure 1. By establishing such a 'fusion higher-category' description of bulk excitations, we expect to have a better approach for studying higher-dimensional strongly interacting quantum phases and phase transitions.

When the system under consideration is constrained by a symmetry, a 'symmetric' version of the above definitions apply. Both the original Hamiltonian and the modified Hamiltonian are composed of local symmetric terms. The equivalence between d-dimensional excitations are given by symmetric d-dimensional finite-depth circuits, where each local gate in the circuits is symmetric and the ancillas added are in symmetric product states. Most of the examples considered in this paper belong to systems with symmetries. For example, fermionic Z<sub>2</sub> parity symmetry, bosonic Z<sub>2</sub> × Z<sub>2</sub> symmetry, etc.

In Ref. [7], we studied the fusion structure of 1-dimensional gapped phases, hence the fusion structure of 1-dimensional excitations inside a higher-dimensional product-state bulk. While the excitation structure of a product-state bulk is relatively easy to identify - they are given by the d-category structure of d-dimensional gapped quantum phases - that of a non-product bulk is not so obvious. For example, in a non-trivial SPT state or the p + ip superconducting state, the ground state wave function is always entangled, so it is not immediately obvious what the full excitation structure should be. In this paper, we argue that invertible phases - phases like SPT and p + ip superconductor, which when combined with an inverse become equivalent to the trivial phase - have
<sup>2</sup>d - 1-dimensional excitations that stand alone in the bulk can be thought of as on top of a trivial d-dimensional excitation. We will always allow the freedom to add a finite density of ancilla degrees of freedom in the form of product states in these equivalence relations.

[PAGE 4]
the same excitation structure as the trivial product state, which forms the same d-category as d-dimensional gapped quantum phases. For SPT phases within the group cohomology classification, this equivalence can be shown with a simple argument based on the symmetric Quantum Cellular Automaton that maps from the trivial phase to the nontrivial SPT phase. We present this argument in section 3. For chiral invertible phases like the p+ip superconductor, the QCA argument does not work. In this case, we establish the result using a 'pumping' procedure in one higher dimension, as discussed in section 4. Moreover, in section 5, we discuss this problem in the Topological Holography context. The Topological Holography framework, also referred to as the Symmetry Topological-Field-Theory or the Symmetry Topological Order framework [5,8–20], realizes D-dimensional quantum phases using a sandwich structure with a D + 1-dimensional topological theory in the bulk. Our argument in section 5 starts by pointing out in section 5.1 that certain gapped boundary conditions of a topological bulk state have only relative differences but no absolute ones. This property is then used in section 5.2 to establish the relation between the excitations in invertible phases and those in trivial phases. To describe fermionic systems with fermion parity symmetry within the topological holography framework, fermion condensation [21] and fermion condensed boundary conditions are necessary. We thus introduce them concretely in lattice models in Appendix A.2. Before getting into these arguments, we discuss in section 2 the relation between the notion of defects and what we call d-dimensional excitations here. It is not essential for understanding the following sections but may clarify some confusion about our perspective and terminology.

[PAGE 5] 2 Defects and Low-Entanglement Excitations
The d-dimensional excitations we discussed above are usually called 'defects' - changes in the ground state wavefunction induced by the modification of Hamiltonian terms along the defect.<sup>3</sup> With this setup, we can talk about the defect being gapped or gapless if the wavefunction with defect is the gapped or gapless (with gapless excitations along the defect) ground state of the modified Hamiltonian. As the ground state of the modified Hamiltonian, defects are static and not dynamical.

Instead, in this paper, we want to take the point of view that these d-dimensional objects are excitations of the original Hamiltonian. We usually do not call such objects with d > 0 ‘excitations' because they are usually not eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian and, moreover, have extensive energy. Usually we are interested in low-energy excitations that contribute to response functions. That worked well for point excitations because their energy is at most finite. Excitations with d > 0 have extensive energy and are high up in the dense part of the spectrum.

How do we then separate these excitations from the rest of the spectrum and study their structure? Being the ground state of a modified Hamiltonian guarantees that the wave function with the d-dimensional excitations still has entanglement area law. Therefore, these excitations have 'low entanglement' (instead of low energy). The set of entanglement area law preserving d-dimensional excitations is the object of interest here, and we will call them 'Low-Entanglement Excitations' (LEE). These low-entanglement excitations will form the higher-category structure discussed above. Being low-entanglement, these excitations can be studied starting from the ground state wavefunction without reference to the original or modified parent Hamiltonians. They are modifications of the ground state wavefunction that preserves the entanglement area-law and their equivalence is given by finite depth circuits. Therefore, we expect that the structure of the LEEs to be the same for the same ground state wave-function with different parent Hamiltonians. Their exact energy can be different with respect to different parent Hamiltonians, but their higher category structures remain the same.

As excitations, we can talk about their dynamics and stability. Since these LEEs are in general not eigenstates, they will deform and change under the dynamics induced by the Hamiltonian. As the Hamiltonian has a higher energy only along the defect, the induced dynamics is concentrated near the d-dimensional manifold. Now since the equivalence class of the d-dimensional LEEs are given by finite depth d-dimensional circuits, the excitations will remain stable (be in the same class) for a finite time under the dynamics induced by the Hamiltonian. On the other hand, we can also design the unitary operations to be applied to move, deform and fuse the d-dimensional excitations, all with finite depth circuits [22].

What is the physical importance of LEEs? Since LEEs with d > 1 have extensive energy, they do not play any role in the linear response of the system under external perturbation. But with low entanglement, the LEEs can potentially be condensed, driving phase transitions between different gapped phases. Once the LEEs are condensed, they do not cost energy any more. Moreover, with low entanglement, their condensate can also have low entanglement (area law), and potentially realize a different gapped phase. Therefore, we expect LEEs to play an important role in the description of phase transitions.

<sup>3</sup>A symmetry defect is a prototypical example where the change in Hamiltonian is induced by applying symmetry to a sub-region in the system. Hamiltonian terms on the boundary of the sub-region changes by conjugating half of each term with the symmetry. Hamiltonian terms away from the boundary remain invariant.


[PAGE 6] 3 Symmetric QCA argument

3.1 General Argument

The equivalence of the excitation structure of an invertible phase and that of a trivial product state can be easily established for a large class of invertible phases: those that can be prepared from a trivial product state by a quantum cellular automata (QCA). On a quantum many-body lattice system, a QCA is a locality-preserving unitary operator [23]. Under conjugation by a QCA, local operators are mapped to local operators, and the operator algebra is preserved. A simple example of a QCA is a finite depth transformation of local unitaries (FDLU) (a.k.a., finite depth quantum circuit), but there are also QCA that are not FDLUs such as the lattice translation operator.

In the presence of a symmetry, we say that a QCA is symmetric if it commutes with all symmetry operators. Hence, a symmetric QCA maps symmetric local operators to symmetric local operators and charged local operators to local operators of the same charge. A symmetric QCA is trivial if it is a symmetric FDLU, i.e. an FDLU for which each gate individually commutes with all symmetry operators. A typical example of non-trivial symmetric QCAs in a bosonic lattice system is the SPT entangler, which is an FDLU that commutes as a whole with the symmetry operators but individual gates do not so that the circuit can map a trivial product state to an SPT state [24]. We want to emphasize that here we define a symmetric QCA to be a QCA that is symmetric. That is, it is locality preserving on all operators and further more symmetric. We want to contrast it with, for example, the Kramers-Wannier transformation [25], which maps symmetric local operators to symmetric local operators but does not preserve the locality of charged operators.

For each SPT phase within the group cohomology classification, we can identify an SPT entangler that generates a fixed-point state from the trivial product state [24]. In such fixed-point states, we can straightforwardly argue that the classification of LEEs is the same as in the trivial phase. Suppose we start in the trivial phase and insert a d-dimensional LEE. Then, apply the SPT entangler to the entire system. This results in a system belonging to the SPT phase with a new defect. Because the SPT entangler is a symmetric QCA, it maps the original LEE onto a new defect with the same dimension and support (up to a constant increase). Furthermore, since applying a QCA preserves the area law, the new defect still has area law entanglement. Therefore, it defines an LEE in the SPT phase. Similarly, we can start with an LEE in the SPT phase and apply the inverse SPT entangler to obtain the corresponding LEE in the trivial phase. Finally, if two LEEs in one phase are related by a symmetric FDLU, then this FDLU can be pulled through the SPT entangler to obtain an operator that relates the two corresponding LEE in the other phase. Since the SPT entangler is a symmetric QCA, it maps symmetric FDLUs onto symmetric FDLUs, so this new operator is again a symmetric FDLU. Therefore, the classifications of LEEs are the same in the trivial and group cohomology SPT phases. If we further assume that all LEEs in the trivial phase can be created using a sequential quantum circuit, as was argued in Ref. [2], then the same reasoning as above shows that this is also true for all LEEs in SPT phases.

The above argument can be extended to some SPT phases beyond the group cohomology classification. In particular, Ref. [26] constructed a 4-dimensional state that belongs to a beyond cohomology SPT phase. They further showed that this state can be prepared from a trivial product state using a symmetric QCA. Therefore, the above argument applies verbatim to this example.

[PAGE 7] 3.2 Example: 1d cluster state

As a simple example of the symmetric QCA argument, consider the 1D cluster state defined on a lattice of 2N qubits with periodic boundary conditions [27],

|C) = U<sub>c</sub>|++...+),     (1)

where,

U<sub>c</sub> = Π<sub>i=1</sub><sup>2N</sup> CZ<sub>i,i+1</sub>,     (2)

is the SPT entangler for the cluster state with CZ = |0><0|⊗I + |1><1|⊗Z. The cluster state is also the ground state of the Hamiltonian H<sub>c</sub> = -Σ<sub>i</sub> Z<sub>i-1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>Z<sub>i+1</sub> since it satisfies <C|Z<sub>i-1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>Z<sub>i+1</sub>|C> = 1. The state possesses non-trivial SPT order with respect to the Z<sub>2</sub> × Z<sub>2</sub> symmetry generated by X<sub>even</sub> = Π<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> X<sub>2i</sub> and X<sub>odd</sub> = Π<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> X<sub>2i-1</sub> [28].

This non-trivial SPT order can be seen from the non-trivial string order <C|Z<sub>i-1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>X<sub>i+2</sub>...X<sub>i+2L</sub>Z<sub>i+2L+1</sub>|C> = 1 which implies, among other things, that the cluster state cannot be prepared from a trivial product state using a symmetric FDLU [29]. One can confirm that the entangler U<sub>c</sub> commutes with both of these symmetries as a whole, but the individual CZ gates do not commute, so U<sub>c</sub> is a non-trivial symmetric QCA. In the trivial phase represented by |++...+), the distinct class of non-trivial LEEs can be represented by symmetry charges. These are created by applying Z at a single even or odd site, or a pair of neighboring sites. In the present case, these Z operators commute with the entangler U<sub>c</sub>, so they also produce distinct LEEs when acting on the cluster state. One can try to make a new kind of LEE in the cluster state by inserting a symmetry flux, which is accomplished by conjugating all Hamiltonian terms by a symmetry operator acting on half the system. But, this turns out to be equivalent to inserting a symmetry charge. To be concrete, suppose we pick an even site j and conjugate all Hamiltonian terms by the operator X<sub>even</sub> = Π<sub>i>j</sub> X<sub>2i</sub>. This has the effect of flipping the sign of the Hamiltonian term at site i = j - 1, which can also be accomplished by instead inserting a symmetry charge (conjugating with Z) at site j - 1. Therefore, we see that the LEEs in the trivial phase and SPT phase containing the cluster state are identical.

[PAGE 8] 4 The p+ip Superconductor case

The QCA argument used in the previous section does not apply to chiral invertible phases like the p+ip superconductor in 2 + 1D. This is because states created from a product state using a QCA necessarily have zero correlation length, whereas chiral invertible phases require a non-zero correlation length. In this section, we make use of a 'pumping' procedure in one higher dimension and argue that the low-entanglement excitations (LEE) in the 2+1D p+ip superconducting state have the same classification as the LEEs in the trivial 2 + 1D superconductor.

[PAGE 8] 4.1 Pumping p+ip through 3+1D bulk

First, we describe the process of pumping a p+ip state across multiple layers in a 2D system using a finite time evolution. Consider a 2D layered system with fermion modes on the lattice sites in each layer. Suppose that we start from the trivial product state |000...0> with no fermion on each lattice site. This is the ground state of the Hamiltonian H = Σ<sub>i</sub>c<sup>†</sup><sub>i</sub>c<sub>i</sub>. Now take every two horizontal xy layers (layer 2k-1 and 2k) and adiabatically evolve them to a pair of p+ip and p-ip states. Next, shift one layer and take the pair of p-ip state on layer 2k and the p+ip state on layer 2k + 1 and adiabatically evolve them back to the trivial product state. If we apply this procedure to a system with the top layer connected to the bottom layer, then the whole system returns to the product state. If we apply this to a system with open boundaries in the z direction, then in the second step, the evolution does not involve the top and bottom layer and they remain in the p+ip and p-ip states, respectively, while the middle part of the system goes back to the product state.

This adiabatic process can be converted into a finite-time evolution with a quasi-local Hamiltonian,

U = T exp{i∫<sub>0</sub><sup>T</sup> dt D<sub>t</sub>},     (3)

where T denotes time ordering and T is a finite constant independent of system size. The Hamiltonian generating the evolution D<sub>t</sub> can be obtained from the quasi-adiabatic continuation procedure [30]. Note that because the adiabatic process involves two layers at a time, U is strictly locality preserving in the z direction. But it is quasi-local in the x and y directions. That is, if we conjugate a (strictly) local operator by U, it is going to acquire (generically) exponentially decaying tails in the x and y directions but not in the z direction. It can grow in the z direction by at most a distance of four.

Note that U does not help us to prepare a single p-ip layer since it also creates a corresponding p+ip layer at the top. Even if we truncate U to act only on the Hamiltonian terms of the bottom m layers in the product state, it does not give us a 2D Hamiltonian for the p-ip state. This is because the transformed Hamiltonian terms act on m+2 layers such that we need to add more Hamiltonian terms to avoid extensive degeneracy, and the added terms will inevitably generate a p+ip state. Therefore, U does not induce a QCA for preparing a p-ip state in a strictly 2D system, even if we allow for exponentially decaying tails. However, as we show below, it is still sufficient for proving the equivalence of LEE classes between the p+ip and trivial superconductors.

[PAGE 9] 4.2 Low-entanglement excitations

Now we can argue for the equivalence in the classification of low-entanglement excitations in the trivial and the p-ip state. If we start from the trivial state (on the left-hand side of Figure 2) with some LEE within the bottom n layers, applying U would map the system to the p+ip state at the top and the p-ip state at the bottom (on the right-hand side of Figure 2) with some LEE in the bottom n + 2 layers. The layers above the bottom n + 2 layers are still in the product state and will not be affected by the existence of the LEE (because of the strict locality of U in the z-direction). If the LEE before the mapping is gapped (has entanglement area law), the LEE after mapping is gapped (has entanglement area law) as well. The change in the number of layers involved can be accommodated by our freedom to add a finite density of ancillas in relating LEEs. Moreover, now suppose we have two such LEEs in the trivial state and they can be connected through a finite depth circuit acting within the bottom n layers. Then applying U we get a finite-depth circuit mapping between the two LEEs in the p-ip state within the bottom n + 2 layers. Again, the change of number of layers can come from the addition of ancillas. This argument also runs in the reverse direction. Therefore, we see that the LEE equivalence classes for the trivial state and those for the p-ip state are the same.

A similar argument can be applied to other chiral invertible states, such as the Chern insulator, the E<sub>8</sub> state, etc.

[PAGE 9] 5 Topological Holography argument

In this section, we establish the equivalence of LEEs in different invertible phases using the Topological Holography framework. The Topological Holography framework realizes a D-dimensional system using a "sandwich" structure with a D + 1-dimensional topological theory in the bulk, as shown in Figure 3. The top boundary is set to be in a gapped state which, together with the bulk, determines the symmetry of the "sandwich". The bottom boundary contains all the dynamical terms. Therefore, the sandwich structure separates the symmetry (the kinetic aspect) of the system from its dynamics and realizes the symmetry in a topological way.

In the sandwich structure, different invertible phases can be realized by setting the bottom boundary in different gapped states. Due to the invertible nature of the phases, the boundary states can be related to each other through a symmetry transformation of the bulk. The symmetry transformation generated by a FDLU relates any experiments happening near one boundary to those near the other. Therefore, two such boundaries cannot be absolutely distinguished. The only way to tell their difference is to put the two boundary side by side and perform experiments across the domain wall between the two. We explain this point in section 5.1 through several examples. This point may be of interest on its own.

Using the relativeness of the distinction between different gapped boundaries, we establish the equivalence of LEEs in the invertible phases realized with the corresponding "sandwiches". This is discussed, again with several examples, in section 5.2. While the same conclusion was already established in section 3 and section 4, the Topological Holography framework can provide a more natural setting to understand the equivalence between trivial and nontrivial invertible phases. One important distinction between the trivial and non-trivial invertible phases is that the trivial phase can have the product state as its ground state while the nontrivial phases do not have such a limit. Such a distinction can be made when we have a tensor product structure of the underlying Hilbert space. When the invertible phases are realized in the "sandwich" structure, the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space is automatically lost, as the theory is constrained to live in the low-energy subspace fixed by the bulk and the top boundary Hamiltonian terms. Without a tensor product structure, the realization of the trivial and non-trivial invertible phases in the sandwich can have very similar structures. For example, in some cases, two phases can be related to each other through a bulk on-site unitary Z<sub>2</sub> symmetry. It is then actually impossible to define unambiguously which one is the trivial phase and which one is the non-trivial phase. The only way to see their distinction is by putting the two phases side-by-side and detecting non-trivial edge modes on the domain wall, i.e. only the difference between two phases is well-defined.

[PAGE 10] 5.1 Relative distinction between gapped boundaries of topological states

Let us now explain the relative distinction based on the topological holography construction concretely. Topological ordered phases have emergent symmetries. For examples, in two dimensions, point-like topological excitations can be permuted. On a spatial manifold without a boundary, the unitary operators generating the symmetry leave the ground state subspace invariant. However, they act non-trivially on the excited states, as well as within the ground state subspace (or rather, the code space). As a result, on a spatial manifold with a boundary, in general, the symmetry is no longer preserved on the boundary. Specifically, the boundary of a topological state can be gapped when topological excitations are condensed on the boundary. Now consider applying the unitary to the whole space. The bulk is still in a ground state. On the boundary, if certain condensed topological excitations are permuted with uncondensed ones, the boundary state is then changed to another gapped one. Thus different boundary states are also permuted by the unitary.

[PAGE 11] 5.1.1 The Claim

We claim that two gapped boundary states of a topological order that are related by a finite depth transformation of (quasi) local unitaries (FDLU or FDqLU) that leaves the bulk in a ground state, cannot be distinguished by any local experiments near the boundary. By local experiments, we allow, for example, local unitary transformations, or local measurements, and the results are recorded as classical C-numbers. We refer to two states that cannot be distinguished by local experiments as having no absolute distinction.

We further claim that, the two boundary states, though without an absolute difference, can always be distinguished by experiments performed across the boundary between the two. Thus, the two boundary states have relative distinctions.

[PAGE 11] 5.1.2 The Argument

Now we give an argument for the claim. First we describe a property of FDLUs. The FDLU when acting on an operator by conjugation, maps a local operator to a local operator, a line operator to a line operator, etc. That is, the FDLU preserves the "geometry" of the support of an operator: suppose an operator O(Ω<sub>d</sub>) acts on a region Ω<sub>d</sub> of dimension d < D, then after conjugated by a FDLU, the operator is still supported on a region of dimension d. To prove this statement, note first that due to the "light-cone structure” of FDLUs, an operator supported on Ω<sub>d</sub> cannot be mapped to one supported on Ω<sub>k</sub> with k > d. The other half of the statement is that a finite-depth circuit cannot map an operator supported on Ω<sub>d</sub> to an operator supported on Ω<sub>k</sub>, with k < d. We can prove this part by contradiction. Suppose there is a finite-depth circuit U that can map O(Ω<sub>d</sub>) to O'(Ω<sub>k</sub>) with k < d, then the inverse U<sup>-1</sup> maps O'(Ω<sub>k</sub>) to O(Ω<sub>d</sub>). However, this is not possible, since U<sup>-1</sup> is also a finite-depth circuit.

The statement can also be generalized and applies to finite-depth transformation of quasi-local unitaries (FDqLU) with at most exponentially decaying tails. Such FDqLU preserves the "geometry" of the support of an operator, up to an exponentially decaying tail.

Next we focus on the particular FDLUs (or FDqLUs), those that generate emergent symmetries in topological orders. As discussed above, these unitaries leave the bulk in the ground state, but can permute boundary states. Later, we will give explicit examples of such unitaries.

The "geometry-preserving" property of such symmetry-generating finite-depth circuits leads to our claim above. For any local experiment we perform near one boundary, let us record the sequence of operations by O(Ω<sub>d</sub>), where d is at most D, and Ω<sub>d</sub> is composed of a finite number of disconnected components near the boundary. The length of Ω<sub>d</sub> along any dimensions perpendicular to the boundary is finite and independent of the system size. Suppose in the ground state with one gapped boundary condition, denoted as |Ψ>,

[PAGE 12] the result of the experiment is

<Ψ|O(Ω<sub>d</sub>)|Ψ> = x ∈ C.     (4)

Then consider the same ground state with the other gapped boundary condition related by the FDLU (or FDqLU), which is U|Ψ>. Due to the “geometry”-preserving property of U, we can always find another operator, with a support of dimension d also near the boundary,

O'(Ω'<sub>d</sub>) = UO(Ω<sub>d</sub>)U<sup>-1</sup>.     (5)

It is easy to confirm that the experiment performed with the sequence of operations O'(Ω'<sub>d</sub>) produces the same result x on the state U|Ψ>.

[PAGE 12] 5.1.3 Emergent symmetries from invertible defects

What is a general rule to discover emergent symmetries of topological order as well as the FDLUs (or FDqLUs)? One way is to identify the invertible codimension-1 defects in the topological order. Imagine that on the ground state, we apply the unitary U that generates an emergent symmetry yet restricted within a region Ω<sub>D</sub> of dimension D, rather than the entire space. Within Ω<sub>D</sub>, the state is still in the ground state (i.e., the reduced density matrix for a region within Ω<sub>D</sub> is unchanged). Yet, on the boundary of Ω<sub>D</sub>, a symmetry defect is created. Since the inverse of a FD(q)LU is also a FD(q)LU, the defect created by U(Ω<sub>D</sub>) and that created by U<sup>-1</sup>(Ω<sub>D</sub>) always cancel out. Such defects are thus always invertible. Reversely, given a codimension-1 invertible defect in a topological order since sweeping the defect always generates a global emergent 0-form symmetry.

[PAGE 12] 5.1.4 Two copies of toric codes in 2d

Twin states on the boundary Our first example is where the topological bulk is given by two copies of toric codes. Let us label the anyons as {1, e<sup>I</sup>, m<sup>I</sup>, f<sup>I</sup>} × {1, e<sup>II</sup>, m<sup>II</sup>, f<sup>II</sup>}, with e<sup>I</sup>, e<sup>II</sup> the gauge charges, and m<sup>I</sup>, m<sup>II</sup> the gauge fluxes. There are in total 6 types of gapped boundaries for two copies of Z<sub>
