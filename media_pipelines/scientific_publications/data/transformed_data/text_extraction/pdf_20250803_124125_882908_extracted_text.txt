Ivermectin Promotes Peripheral Nerve Regeneration during Wound
Healing

ABSTRACT: Peripheral nerves have the capacity to regenerate due to the presence of neuroprotective glia of the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells. Upon peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells create a permissive microenvironment for neuronal regrowth by taking up cytotoxic glutamate and secreting neurotrophic signaling molecules. Impaired peripheral nerve repair is often caused by a defective Schwann cell response after injury, and there is a critical need to develop new strategies to enhance nerve regeneration, especially in organisms with restricted regenerative potential, such as humans. One approach is to explore mechanisms in lower organisms, in which nerve repair is much more efficient. A recent study demonstrated that the antiparasitic drug, ivermectin, caused hyperinnervation of primordial eye tissue in *Xenopus laevis* tadpoles. Our study aimed to examine the role of ivermectin in mammalian nerve repair. We performed *in vitro* assays utilizing human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) in co-culture with human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and found that ivermectin-treated hDFs promote hiNSC proliferation and migration. We also characterized the effects of ivermectin on hDFs and found that ivermectin causes hDFs to uptake extracellular glutamate, secrete glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, develop an elongated bipolar morphology, and express glial fibrillary acidic protein. Finally, in a corresponding *in vivo* model, we found that localized ivermectin treatment in a dermal wound site induced the upregulation of both glial and neuronal markers upon healing. Taken together, we demonstrate that ivermectin promotes peripheral nerve regeneration by inducing fibroblasts to adopt a glia-like phenotype.

[PAGE 1] INTRODUCTION
Unlike the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has a substantial capacity for repair upon injury. Although peripheral nerve repair is relatively efficient, there are instances in which this process is impaired or even prevented. Approximately 20 million Americans sustain peripheral nerve damage resulting from medical disorders and/or trauma.¹ For example, neuropathy, a condition that occurs upon peripheral nerve damage or disruption, often produces pain and/or loss of sensation and movement, and can result from diabetes, certain autoimmune diseases, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and chemotherapy treatment.² Furthermore, 3-10% of all traumatic injuries result in acute peripheral nerve damage requiring surgical intervention.³ Fewer than half of traumatic injury patients who undergo surgical nerve repair regain good to excellent motor function and sensation.⁴ This type of irreparable peripheral nerve damage can negatively affect a patient's quality of life and may cause severe and permanent sensory and motor function defects that can result in complete paralysis or development of chronic neuropathic pain.⁵ Axonal loss and defective axonal regrowth are responsible for these critical deficits in peripheral nerve repair, while it has been suggested that the microenvironment surrounding axons plays an essential role in this process.

Innate peripheral nerve repair capacity can be attributed at least in part to the highly regenerative glial cells of the PNS, the Schwann cells. Several animal studies have indicated that poor axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury is due at least in part to a defective Schwann cell response.⁶ Schwann cells myelinate peripheral nerves and play an essential role in axon guidance and regeneration. Upon peripheral nerve injury, distal axons degenerate, whereas resident Schwann cells dedifferentiate, become proliferative, and help to create a permissive microenvironment for subsequent neuronal regrowth.⁷ For example, Schwann cells have been implicated in the uptake of cytotoxic glutamate upon neuronal injury.⁸ Furthermore, Schwann cells also secrete extracellular signaling molecules to enhance nerve regeneration. One of the extrinsic factors upregulated by Schwann cells in response to peripheral nerve injury is glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).⁹ GDNF has been shown to promote neuronal growth and survival and has been widely used in the development of various therapeutic strategies for experimental nerve repair, such as diabetic neuropathy and sciatic nerve transection.


[PAGE 2] RESULTS
Differentiated Schwann cells typically exhibit an elongated, bipolar morphology, and begin to upregulate certain cytoskeletal proteins, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).¹⁰ GFAP appears during the formation of immature Schwann cells and is downregulated upon myelination. Interestingly, GFAP plays a prominent role in peripheral nerve regeneration specifically, as it was shown that neuronal regrowth after injury was delayed in GFAP-null mice,¹¹ which is likely due to deficits in Schwann cell regulation.

Strategies to treat peripheral nerve damage have been developed, but have a number of limitations. For patients requiring repair of larger nerve defects and/or traumatic injuries, the primary treatment is an autologous nerve graft, which has multiple drawbacks, such as limited availability of sacrificial nerve tissue, donor site morbidity, and potential neuroma formation. Current treatment for diabetic neuropathy, which is caused by distal nerve death in the extremities as a result of poor vascularization and high blood glucose levels, is pain management, which does not treat the actual nerve damage. There have also been several experimental models that attempt to improve outcomes of diabetic neuropathy. For example, a recent study utilized herpes simplex virus vector-mediated gene transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor for subcutaneous inoculation in the skin in a mouse model of diabetic neuropathy.¹² Although this localized treatment was able to significantly increase the presence of nerve fibers in the skin, this method of virally induced gene transfer is not suitable for certain clinical applications.

Given the various shortcomings of current treatment options, there is a critical need to identify novel targets and to develop new strategies to combat the issue of impaired nerve regeneration. One approach is to examine mechanisms in lower organisms, in which peripheral nerve repair is much more robust and efficient. Certain species of salamander, such as the axolotl, can regenerate entire amputated limbs, including completely functional neural components with tactile sensation and motion.¹³ Many studies have focused on understanding what makes these amphibians retain such a high regenerative capacity into adulthood, whereas so many other vertebrate species do not. Interestingly, denervating the axolotl limb upon amputation inhibits limb regeneration,¹⁴ suggesting that proper innervation is crucial not only for restoring nerve function, but also for overall limb tissue repair.


[PAGE 3] DISCUSSION
Although this organism has the innate capacity for complete regeneration, similar species are not as regenerative, but show a much higher capacity for repair than mammalian systems. For example, the South African clawed frog *Xenopus laevis*, can partly regenerate the tail, spinal cord, and limbs, but not to the same extent as salamanders, as its regenerative capacity steadily decreases as the animal matures.¹⁵ Understanding mechanisms by which to enhance the regenerative capacity as these animals transition from regenerative to nonregenerative can be helpful in devising strategies for enhancing mammalian repair, especially given the well-established reduction in regenerative capacity during aging in humans.¹⁶ For example, a recent study in a *Xenopus* host engraftment model demonstrated that ivermectin could enhance innervation of primordial eye tissue engrafted onto the flanks of early stage tadpoles.¹⁷ Ivermectin is an established antiparasitic drug that is used widely in both clinical and veterinary medicines. In humans, ivermectin is used in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations, such as strongyloidiasis, as well as some parasitic skin diseases, including scabies.¹⁸ At higher doses, ivermectin has been shown to act as a positive regulator of a variety of ion channels and receptors, such as glycine¹⁹ and purinergic receptors,²⁰ many of which are also present in mammalian cells. Locally stimulating these ion channels at the site of nerve damage has the potential to initiate nerve growth and repair. We hypothesized that this newly identified method of increasing innervation in non-regenerative stage frogs may also be useful for inducing innervation in organisms with restricted regenerative potential, like humans.

The goal of this work was to assay the effects of ivermectin on mammalian peripheral nerve repair. To this end, we first developed a series of *in vitro* assays utilizing human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs).²¹ Using a three-dimensional (3D) bilayer collagen gel co-culture system incorporating human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and hiNSCs as a simple *in vitro* tool


[PAGE 4] METHODS
for understanding the complex interactions between these two different cell types, we found that pretreating hDFs with ivermectin caused adjacent hiNSCs to significantly increase proliferation. Similarly, in migration assays using predifferentiated hiNSCs, we found that ivermectin-treated hDFs caused a significant increase in neuronal migration. We also further characterized the effects of ivermectin on hDFs *in vitro*, and found that ivermectin caused hDFs to uptake extracellular glutamate, secrete GDNF, develop an elongated bipolar morphology, and express GFAP, suggesting that ivermectin causes hDFs to adopt a glia-like phenotype. Finally, we translated our *in vitro* findings to a relevant *in vivo* model and found that localized ivermectin treatment in a dermal wound site induced the upregulation of both glial and neuronal markers upon healing. Taken together, our data reveal a novel role for ivermectin in promoting peripheral nerve regeneration during mammalian wound healing.

2.1. Treating Dermal Fibroblasts with Ivermectin Induces Proliferation in Co-cultured hiNSCs. We developed a 3D bilayer collagen gel co-culture system consisting of human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) fluorescently labeled with DiD dye and human dermal fibroblasts (Figure 1A). These hiNSCs are highly proliferative and express Sox1, Sox2, and Nestin (Figure S1). Prior to embedding in separate collagen gels, both cell types were transiently treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 1 μM ivermectin and subsequently washed repeatedly to remove residual drug. hDFs were seeded into the bottom gel, labeled hiNSCs seeded into the top gel, and the bilayer constructs were subsequently cultured for 5 days.

Similar to findings from previous *Xenopus* experiments that indicated noncell-autonomous effects on neural growth,¹⁷ we observed increased neural growth only in those constructs in which hDFs were pretreated with ivermectin (Figure 1B). Upon cryosectioning these bilayer gels, we found that hiNSCs in these constructs expressed significantly higher levels of proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure 1C,D), suggesting that ivermectin-treated hDFs induced proliferation in adjacent hiNSCs in 3D bilayer co-cultures.

2.2. Ivermectin-Treated Fibroblasts Induce Migration of Differentiated Neurons. Having established that ivermectin-treated hDFs induced proliferation of neural stem cells, we also aimed to study their potential effects on neuronal migration. To test this, we seeded hDFs into the bottom transwell of cell culture plates, treated with DMSO or 1 µM ivermectin, then subsequently washed repeatedly to remove residual drug (Figure 2A). In the top of the transwell on the coated 8 µM pore membrane, we seeded DiD-labeled human neurons to minimize the effect of proliferation in the assay. We utilized hiNSCs that had been predifferentiated for 1 week that were no longer proliferative and expressed high levels of pan-neuronal marker β III tubulin (Tujl) (Figure S2A). These transwell systems were cultured in low serum media overnight (to further minimize potential cell proliferation), and the relative number of cells migrating to the bottom of transwells was quantified (Figure 2B,C). Interestingly, ivermectin-treated hDFs demonstrated a significant increase in neuronal migration relative to control-treated cells.

Taken together, we demonstrate that ivermectin treatment of stromal hDFs, but not hiNSCs, had a profound effect on neural growth. Importantly, because the drug was washed out extensively prior to establishing both co-culture models, this suggests that the related effects were the result of the initial pretreatment of separate cell types and not the effect of the drug itself on the entire co-culture constructs.

2.3. Treatment with Ivermectin Causes Dermal Fibroblasts to Adopt Functional Characteristics of Glial Cells. We first hypothesized that ivermectin-treated fibroblasts were removing potentially cytotoxic glutamate from the extracellular microenvironment. To test this, we treated hDFs with various concentrations of ivermectin overnight, then assayed the cell culture media to determine extracellular glutamate concentration. It was previously shown that fibroblast cell culture media contains a large quantity of glutamate as a result of the addition of L-glutamine, a precursor of glutamate, to many types of media formulations.²² Interestingly, we found that treatment of hDFs with ivermectin resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease of extracellular glutamate concentration (Figure 3A), suggesting that ivermectin-treated fibroblasts might also be able to uptake extracellular glutamate released by neurons upon injury.

We hypothesized that ivermectin treatment of hDFs was eliciting some type of paracrine effect on neighboring hiNSCs. As such, we also aimed to determine whether ivermectin caused fibroblasts to express any neurotrophic factors. We treated hDFs with vehicle or 1 µM ivermectin for 4 days, then subjected them to qRT-PCR analysis to assay for expression of various growth factors. We found that although there was no significant effect of ivermectin on brain-derived neurotrophic factor or nerve growth factor after 4 days, ivermectin-treated hDFs dramatically upregulated expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Figure 3B), a factor shown to be highly expressed by astrocytes and Schwann cells.⁷ To confirm if GDNF was also upregulated at the protein level, we treated hDFs with increasing amounts of ivermectin and immunostained against GDNF, and found that exposure to ≥1 µM ivermectin increased GDNF expression (Figure 3C). Upon determining that GDNF was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein level, we also aimed to understand if GDNF was also being secreted. hDFs were treated with increasing concentrations of ivermectin for 4 days, and hDF-conditioned media was harvested, filtered, and subjected to GDNF ELISA. Interestingly, we found that at concentrations ≥2.5 µM, ivermectin caused hDFs to secrete significant levels of GDNF protein into the media (Figure 3D). Ivermectin concentrations ≥5 µM appeared to be cytotoxic *in vitro* (Figure S3).
