[PAGE 3] Abstract
Biological systems employ hierarchical regulatory networks to maintain structure and function
at multiple scales, from molecules to whole organisms. This manuscript draws on evidence from
various fields such as immunology, developmental biology, neuroscience and evolutionary
ecology to examine how foreign agents (for instance, pathogens, parasites, trophoblasts) and self-
defecting agents (such as cancer cells) override these networks and exploit the host's plasticity
and regulatory flexibility, reshaping system morphology, function and behaviour. By breaching
physical and informational barriers, mimicking host signals, and altering immune defences,
intruders take advantage of multiscale information processing, propagating their influence across
levels, from local bioelectric states to higher-order endocrine and neural circuits. Through these
mechanisms, intruders disrupt homeostatic setpoints, creating periods of heightened plasticity
that enable system reprogramming resulting in redirection of metabolic flows and overriding of
neural, immune and endocrine signalling. These manipulation strategies rely on conserved
mechanisms, transforming stable structures into flexible substrates for rearrangement,
remodelling host tissues and creating niches that favour their survival. Understanding these
routes of exploitation clarifies core biological principles of self-organisation and identity
maintenance. Mapping how intruders induce plasticity and modify host form and function
informs therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal tissue states, while also opening
potential new paths for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

[PAGE 4] I. Introduction
Biological systems manipulation by internal or external agents occurs broadly in nature,
appearing in immunology, host-pathogen interactions, microbiome studies, oncology, molecular
biology, genetics and bioengineering, as well as in evolutionary ecology and animal behaviour.
In biology, an 'agent' can be any entity – molecules, cells or organisms - capable of causing
changes in a biological system. Here, we focus on living agents or organisms: bacteria, archaea,
eukaryotes and, also, viruses which straddle the line between living and non-living entities, and
the ways these systems hack each other's form and function. A key property of living matter is
its dynamic, multiscale organisation, which consists of nested self-regulating systems that exhibit
partial autonomy in addressing diverse functional challenges (Fields & Levin, 2022; Levin,
2023c; Davies & Levin, 2023), making them susceptible to manipulation by higher-level signals
and information. Thus, the hacker metaphor (Rule, Tenenbaum & Piantadosi, 2020) is relevant
here as these agents manipulate complex systems by subverting default control paths and
outcomes. This manipulation occurs at all levels – from rewiring the molecular “hardware” to
the high-level “social engineering” in cell collectives (McMillen & Levin, 2024; Levin, 2023a;
Levin, 2022).

Living organisms sharing an environment interact in many ways, including parasitism, predation,
symbiosis and social manipulation. The relationship between an agent and its environment is
interdependent: the agent is influenced by its environment and, in turn, modifies it to achieve its
goals. Gaining environmental control enhances survival, reproduction, resource availability, and
defence. When multiple agents with differing goals share a habitat, taking control over the
environment becomes advantageous. Here, we focus on scenarios wherein one agent (an intruder)
invades and alters another agent's (the host) environment and exploits it for its own advantage.
Mutualistic or obligate symbioses, where both parties depend on each other or suffer upon
separation, are excluded. Instead, the focus is on cases where one agent advances its own interests
at the expense of another's normal function or development.

Whilst an agent must extract resources and respond to environmental signals, it must also
preserve its stability and identity as a separate entity. This is achieved through various
mechanisms including barrier functions, homeostatic controls and regulatory networks.
Understanding how intruders override these protective mechanisms provides insight into both
basic biological principles and potential therapeutic strategies.

An intruder can either be a foreign agent or a self-defecting agent. Examples of foreign agents
include heterologous transplants, pathogens, commensal and symbiotic organisms, or invasive
species in the context of larger-scale ecosystems. A self-defecting agent - such as a cancer cell -
is an intrinsic component of the host system that actively deviates from the cooperative regulatory
networks essential for maintaining physiological, metabolic and anatomical homeostasis. In this
context, 'self-defecting' denotes a departure from the integrated, collective behaviour that
characterises healthy tissues (Nowak, 2006; Aktipis et al., 2013). This paper examines
manipulation from the cellular to the organismal scale, including certain aspects of social
interactions at higher levels.

The study of biological manipulation offers a unique perspective on morphology and
development, fields where common principles and mechanisms remain unclear. Unlike familiar
passive materials which have been engineered for thousands of years, cells and tissues offer a
multi-scale architecture of distributed, homeodynamic competencies (Bernheim-Groswasser et
al., 2018; Davies & Levin, 2023). We have previously highlighted advantages in prediction and
control that can be achieved by leveraging cell collectives' modularity: specific stimuli induce
complex, coordinated downstream responses, such as the formation of entire organs (Lagasse &
Levin, 2023; Levin, 2024a). Harnessing the problem-solving abilities of cellular materials in
medicine and bioengineering requires an understanding of the signals that are meaningful to the
host tissues, as well as the principles by which specific desired changes can be communicated
through bioelectric, biochemical, and biomechanical interfaces. To drive progress in this field,
we examine examples where active manipulation and exploitation of host form, function and
behavioural plasticity alters the system's structure (morphology). Understanding how
morphology, physiology, and behaviour are shaped not only enhances our comprehension of
fundamental biological processes and disease pathology, but also holds significant implications
for the development of therapeutic interventions, cellular reprogramming, tissue remodelling,
regeneration, and the design of novel bioengineered constructs.

Here, we first describe how cells and tissues maintain coherent structure and function across
multiple scales, highlighting the multi-level regulatory architecture that both confers stability and
presents potential vulnerabilities. We then show how foreign or self-defecting agents exploit
these weaknesses to reshape host form and function.

[PAGE 5] II. Hierarchical organisation in living systems
(1) Multilevel information processing
Biological systems exhibit a hierarchical organisation in which smaller units—molecules,
organelles and individual cells - are nested within progressively larger structures such as tissues,
organs and entire organisms (Fig. 1). Each level in this hierarchy has its own capacity for sensing,
decision-making and self-maintenance, yet remains integrated with higher-order control systems
(Fields & Levin, 2022). This multiscale arrangement enables distributed information processing
that helps organisms adapt to complex, ever-changing environments.

The relationship between these nested agents is defined by three key principles: containment,
communication, and control. Containment refers to the physical boundaries that define each
agent - from plasma membranes in cells to tissue barriers in organs. These boundaries are not
passive containers but active interfaces that regulate the flow of materials and information
shaping how cells and tissues perceive and respond to internal or external signals. At the smallest
scale, cellular membranes separate cytoplasm from the extracellular milieu, regulating ion
gradients and selective transport. At higher levels, tissue barriers such as basement membranes
and endothelial linings maintain compartmental integrity, while in the central nervous system,
the blood-brain barrier protects the neural microenvironment by filtering substances and immune
cells (Daneman & Prat, 2015).

Communication operates across a vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Rapid signalling via
membrane potential changes or gap junctions synchronises local cellular states (Levin, 2021;
Funk & Scholkmann, 2023). Conversely, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines function over
longer distances and longer timescales, integrating cell and tissue behaviour into coherent organ-
level or organism-level responses. Mechanical forces also transmit information: changes in
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or tension can trigger large-scale shifts in tissue architecture
and cell fate (Vining & Mooney, 2017; Mammoto & Ingber, 2010; Mammoto, Mammoto &
Ingber, 2013). Together, these signalling modalities create nested feedback loops that enable

[PAGE 5]
control that can be achieved by leveraging cell collectives' modularity: specific stimuli induce
complex, coordinated downstream responses, such as the formation of entire organs (Lagasse &
Levin, 2023; Levin, 2024a). Harnessing the problem-solving abilities of cellular materials in
medicine and bioengineering requires an understanding of the signals that are meaningful to the
host tissues, as well as the principles by which specific desired changes can be communicated
through bioelectric, biochemical, and biomechanical interfaces. To drive progress in this field,
we examine examples where active manipulation and exploitation of host form, function and
behavioural plasticity alters the system's structure (morphology). Understanding how
morphology, physiology, and behaviour are shaped not only enhances our comprehension of

these weaknesses to reshape host form and function.

II. Hierarchical organisation in living systems

[PAGE 5]
(1) Multilevel information processing

Biological systems exhibit a hierarchical organisation in which smaller units—molecules,
organelles and individual cells - are nested within progressively larger structures such as tissues,
organs and entire organisms (Fig. 1). Each level in this hierarchy has its own capacity for sensing,
decision-making and self-maintenance, yet remains integrated with higher-order control systems
(Fields & Levin, 2022). This multiscale arrangement enables distributed information processing
that helps organisms adapt to complex, ever-changing environments.

The relationship between these nested agents is defined by three key principles: containment,
communication, and control. Containment refers to the physical boundaries that define each
agent - from plasma membranes in cells to tissue barriers in organs. These boundaries are not
passive containers but active interfaces that regulate the flow of materials and information
shaping how cells and tissues perceive and respond to internal or external signals. At the smallest
scale, cellular membranes separate cytoplasm from the extracellular milieu, regulating ion
gradients and selective transport. At higher levels, tissue barriers such as basement membranes
and endothelial linings maintain compartmental integrity, while in the central nervous system,
the blood-brain barrier protects the neural microenvironment by filtering substances and immune
cells (Daneman & Prat, 2015).

Communication operates across a vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Rapid signalling via
membrane potential changes or gap junctions synchronises local cellular states (Levin, 2021;
Funk & Scholkmann, 2023). Conversely, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines function over
longer distances and longer timescales, integrating cell and tissue behaviour into coherent organ-
level or organism-level responses. Mechanical forces also transmit information: changes in
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or tension can trigger large-scale shifts in tissue architecture
and cell fate (Vining & Mooney, 2017; Mammoto & Ingber, 2010; Mammoto, Mammoto &
Ingber, 2013). Together, these signalling modalities create nested feedback loops that enable
complex responses, such as immune activation in distant tissues or synchronized developmental
transitions.

[PAGE 7]
(2) Coordinated multimodal networks

Biological coherence refers to the coordinated behaviour of components that enables higher-
order organisation, from individual cells to entire organisms (Kitano, 2004; Delvenne, Lambiotte
& Rocha, 2015) (Fig. 1). This coordination depends on network motifs - such as negative
feedback loops, feed-forward loops, and oscillatory circuits - that create robust yet adaptable
regulatory systems (Alon, 2007).

Tissue level coherence arises from shared signalling pathways, cell-cell communication and
mechanical integration. For example, in the intestinal epithelium, specialized cell types
enterocytes, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells - coordinate nutrient absorption and barrier
integrity through direct membrane contacts and paracrine interactions. This coordination spans
multiple timescales, from transient calcium fluxes (milliseconds) to transcriptional changes
(hours) and structural remodelling (days), integrated by molecular clock components that ensure
synchronised activity. Organ-level coherence emerges when tissues cooperate to fulfil a unified
function. The heart exemplifies this principle: cardiac muscle, connective tissue, pacemaker cells
and vascular endothelium form a synchronised, contractile system. Electrical impulses from the
sinoatrial node spread through specialized conduction pathways, while the extracellular matrix
aligns force transmission to ensure efficient pumping. At the organismal level, coherence
manifests in integrated physiological responses. During exercise, the cardiovascular, respiratory
and muscular systems adjust their activity in concert. The nervous system orchestrates acute
alterations in heart rate and ventilation via neural reflexes, while endocrine signals such as
catecholamines and glucocorticoids mediate longer-term adaptations. Inflammation, injury repair
and other systemic processes rely on constant feedback between local cell populations and the
central regulatory axes.

This multilevel coherence depends on communication systems which enables continuous
monitoring and dynamic adjustment. Gap junctions coordinate local cell activity, whereas
endocrine and neural signals integrate tissues and organs into organism-level feedback loops,
with nanotubes, cytonemes and other mechanisms facilitating tissue-level communication
(McMillen et al., 2021; Yamashita, Inaba & Buszczak, 2018; Ariazi et al., 2017). Coherent
systems thus display resilience: if one component fails, others compensate to maintain overall
function. In wound healing, local immune cells, fibroblasts and progenitor cells coordinate a
regenerative response, while systemic signals maintain metabolic support. Importantly, intruders
and self-defecting agents exploit these same networks. By mimicking host signals, disrupting
hub nodes, or inserting new pathways, they co-opt the very processes that sustain system-wide
coherence.


[PAGE 8]
(3) Dynamic homeostasis and stability

Homeostasis - the maintenance of internal conditions within a viable range – is fundamental to
physiology, ensuring reliable function despite environmental fluctuations (Modell et al., 2015;
Meizlish et al., 2021; Medzhitov, 2021). Far from being static, homeostasis involves dynamic
control of variables such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure and metabolic energy stores.
Multiple regulatory loops operate at every level, from intracellular buffers to organism-wide
neuroendocrine axes, thereby conferring robustness and adaptability.

A straightforward way to conceptualise homeostatic loops is through a four-step framework: (i)
detection of changes in key environmental or internal variables, (ii) processing the incoming
information (e.g. thresholding, saliency detection, coarse-graining) relative to a stored setpoint,
(iii) a response to minimize detected error (which can propagate non-locally as stress), and (iv)
cycles of feedback. Although this sequence seems simple, it has considerable complexity of
biological control, as multiple competing demands must be simultaneously weighed and
integrated. Living systems rarely regulate a single parameter in isolation; rather, they constantly
balance trade-offs, such as thermoregulation vs. fluid conservation, or immune surveillance vs.
nutrient allocation. Prioritising and integrating these demands represents homeostatic
adaptability.

Homeostasis involves various mechanisms that work together to maintain a stable internal
environment within an organism: negative feedback (for instance, maintenance of blood glucose
level or body temperature), positive feedback (for example, the blood clotting or immune
cascades), feedforward/anticipatory mechanisms (increasing body fat in preparation for winter
or glycogenolysis before exercise), oscillatory mechanisms (such as the circadian rhythm or
cardiac cycle), structural mechanisms (for instance, cell membrane, skin barrier, nephrons in the
kidneys, alveoli in the lungs or structure of neurons). These mechanisms have distinct dynamic
properties and function across various timescales, from rapid ion fluxes to slower metabolic
shifts. Integrating these responses ensures robust yet flexible homeostatic control (Fig. 1).

Homeostasis maintains at different levels and by different levels. For instance, osmoregulation
on the level of individual cells will involve cell membrane regulation (influx and efflux of
materials) (Strange, 2004), contractile vacuoles (pushes the water out of the cell in some
unicellular organisms) (Du et al., 2008), osmoprotectants (small organic molecules which
accumulate in cells and protect against osmotic stress) (Slama et al., 2015), activation of
signalling pathways and transcriptional factors (Zhou et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2019), expression
of proteins (such as HSP-70 to maintain proper protein folding (Woo et al., 2002)), adjustment
of metabolic processes (for instance enzyme and structural proteins adaptation that remain stable
and active at high salt concentrations in halophiles)(Edbeib, Wahab & Huyop, 2016; Gunde-
Cimerman, Plemenitaš & Oren, 2018). Tissue-level osmotic homeostasis involves fluid exchange
with capillaries and lymphatics, as seen in inflammation (Abdulkhaleq et al., 2018). An example
of osmoregulation on the organ level is brain's osmoregulatory independence, maintained by the
blood-brain barrier (Abbott et al., 2010). The illustration for the organ system and organismal
levels is how the human body responds to dehydration. The organ systems contribute to
osmoregulation in its own unique way, for instance: endocrine system activate renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, antidiuretic hormone release, thirst stimulation; the renal system conserve
water, integumentary system reduce sweat production, the nervous system triggers the
sympathetic nervous system and motive the behaviours to seek out and consume water. At the
organismal level, the regulation goas beyond the individual system responses and involve
coordination of these systems to work together, for instance, the signals from the nervous and
endocrine systems coordinating these responses to effectively mitigate the effects of dehydration.


[PAGE 9]
Homeostatic regulation balances stability and adaptability. While stability is essential for optimal
function, biological systems must retain sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing environmental
demands. This balance is achieved through multiple mechanisms, including: 1) variable tolerance
ranges that can be adjusted based on physiological state; 2) hierarchical control systems where
local fluctuations are permitted within global constraints; 3) redundant regulatory pathways that
provide backup mechanisms; 4) adaptive reset points that can shift in response to persistent
changes.

Each biological component supports the functions of a higher-order unit. This hierarchical
support structure allows for the multiscale organisation of biological systems, beginning from
subcellular units and building up to cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. Homeostatic
mechanisms act across this hierarchy to maintain stability and optimal functionality. The main
challenge in studying and influencing homeostasis lies in its highly integrated and multi-
dimensional nature, where numerous factors - cellular, genetic, epigenetic, biochemical,
bioelectrical - operate in precise timing and coordination. If one mechanism fails, others
compensate, preserving system stability. While essential for survival, compensatory mechanisms
can mask underlying regulatory disruptions until critical thresholds are reached. Understanding
these thresholds and the conditions under which compensatory mechanisms fail is crucial for
both therapeutic intervention and understanding how manipulating agents can override host
regulatory systems.

Maintenance of identity

Biological systems maintain a coherent identity despite continual turnover of cells, molecules
and structures (Fig. 1). This capacity operates at multiple organisational levels, making living
agents active processes rather than entities that merely conserve specific components (Levin,
2024b; Solch, 2016). Recent studies have begun to characterise biological components not only
by their metabolic and physical properties but also by their capacity to process and transmit
information, positioning them as fundamentally informational (proto-cognitive) entities
(Bongard & Levin, 2023; Kuchling et al., 2020; Fields & Levin, 2020a; Fields & Levin, 2020b;
Fields & Levin, 2019).

Cell maintains its identity – a unique combination of characteristics that distinguish one cell from
another - through various cellular processes including gene expression patterns, the set of
proteins produced and membrane integrity (Blazek, Paleo & Weisleder, 2015). The cell
membrane not only segregate the intracellular from the extracellular environment, but also serves
as an information processing interface that interprets mechanical, electrical and chemical cues,
and therefore allow cell to be a separate agent. Cells allocate significant resources to maintain
membrane potential (Vmem). Vmem is a form of stored energy for various functions. In multicellular
organism, this bioelectric potential scales up to form a computational system that coordinates
and integrates the activities of individual cells into larger, harmonised networks (Levin, 2023a).
This bioelectric state serves as both an energetic resource and an information-carrying medium,
enabling rapid cellular responses to environmental changes. Vmem is what creates cell's own
controlled internal environment. The degree of cell autonomy or agency depends on to which
extend the cell can control and change its Vmem. Beyond basic boundary maintenance, cells
preserve their identity through multiple overlapping mechanism. For instance, DNA repair
pathways maintain the integrity of the original DNA sequence (Chatterjee & Walker, 2017),
while protein quality control pathways that recycle or refold damaged proteins.

Tissues develop a collective identity governed by the spatial arrangement of specialized cell
types, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and local signalling networks. Cell-cell junctions reinforce
tissue architecture, coherence, and synchronisation. For instance, epithelial tissues rely on tight
junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes to maintain polarity, structural integrity, selective
transport and synchronised signal propagation. There are various mechanisms how tissue
maintain self-identity and morphology, for instance by the regulatory mechanisms of cell polarity
and adhesion molecules (Guzmán-Herrera & Mao, 2020) or tissue-specific transcription factors
which associated with tissue environment (Sonawane et al., 2017).

Organs derive identity from spatial organisation and functional integration of diverse cell
populations into a functional whole. For instance, the liver's zonation requires precise
architectural arrangement of hepatocytes, endothelial cells and immune cells (Kupffer cells) to
optimise nutrient and oxygen gradients. Wnt/ẞ-catenin and hedgehog signalling pathways
maintain these zonation patterns and coordinate the organ's adaptive capacity (Matsumoto &
Kikuchi, 2024). Organs maintain function and structure despite cell turnover.

At the organism scale, the interplay of neural, endocrine, and immune systems enables
coordinated responses to environmental challenges and surveillance that preserves homeostasis
through anomaly detection. The immune system, for example, distinguishes self from non-self
through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which present antigens to T cells.
Cells lacking MHC or displaying foreign peptides are usually targeted for elimination. Nervous


[PAGE 11]
system bioelectric integration and endocrine feedback loops support organismal coherence,
ensuring that local perturbations are flagged or compensated across multiple tissues.

Higher organisational levels have broader perspective, capabilities and operational scope due to
increased complexity and resource availability. Each ascending level of organisation not only
coordinates lower-level functions but also acquires novel capabilities that emerge from this
coordination (synergy). These emergent properties enable higher-level systems to pursue
objectives and respond to challenges in ways that would be impossible for their individual
components possibly conceive or achieve. This hierarchical organisation creates both
opportunities and vulnerabilities for manipulation. Higher-level control systems can effectively
coordinate responses across multiple tissues, but their complexity also provides multiple points
for intervention by manipulating agents.

Biological systems preserve a coherent identity yet remain sufficiently flexible to respond to
environmental challenges and ensure survival. Plasticity is short-term, reversible adjustments
that allow agents to modify their function without losing core identity. This flexibility extends
from subcellular processes, including DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling, to
organismal strategies like thermotolerance and behavioural changes. Immune cells, for instance,
can shift their phenotype in response to pathogens or tissue damage while retaining lineage
markers. At the tissue level, bone undergoes mechanical remodelling, while the intestinal
epithelium revises absorptive properties in response to dietary cues. Crucially, such shifts occur
within defined limits safeguarding structural and functional integrity.

A clear example of machinery to maintain ‘self” in relation to homeostasis and plasticity across
multiple levels is immune surveillance. The immune system has a range of mechanisms which
control the self-identity by countering external threats such as pathogens and internal disruptions
like tumour formation. For instance, cells have evolved to recognise pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) inside and outside the cell by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
that allows cells to rapidly respond to infections, and alert neighbouring cells about the threat.
Another very important mechanism of identify "self" versus "non-self" which is the feature of
higher organisational level is the presentation of pieces of proteins from inside the cell to the
exterior by MHC. If MHC presented proteins are foreign (e.g., viral or bacterial or cancer), they
can be recognized and targeted by immune cells. If cell does not have MHC (a common feature
in virally infected or tumour cells) or mismatch MHC (foreign cell), the cell will be also aimed
by immune cells. Any cells which exhibit signs of stress (due to various reasons such as DNA
damage, metabolic imbalance or mechanical damage) are also immune targets. Stressed cells
express abnormal proteins, alter cell surface markers, and release or present "danger" signals
DAMPs. These signals can attract immune cells and highlight the stressed cell for inspection or
elimination. The timely removal of stressed or damaged cells prevents the accumulation of
malfunctioning cells which could potentially become neoplastic or disrupt tissue function and
homeostasis.

The plasticity of the immune system is fundamental to its function and the brightest example of
this plasticity is immunological memory. Although, the individual immune cells possess innate
immune memory (trained immunity) (Netea et al., 2016), the single cell or unstructured
collection of the cells cannot develop the sophisticated immunological memory – the feature of
the adaptive immune system, which enables faster, more effective responses to previously
encountered pathogens. This kind of immunological memory is generated by the system and
requires highly coordinated interactions among different cell types (such as antigen-presenting
cells, T cells, and B cells) and structures (for instance, lymphoid organs). Therefore, the memory


[PAGE 12]
about the past experiences persists in the system far beyond the lifespan of the original
responding cells. Thus, the system uses learned behaviours and experiences provide by its parts
for its own adaptation.

Self-identity is maintained through surveillance mechanisms that detect and respond to
deviations from homeostatic setpoints. A compelling hypothesis suggests that certain self-
reactive immune cells may perform interoceptive functions by monitoring tissue states through
recognition of cell type- and state-specific antigens. These proposed 'Tx cells' would work
alongside regulatory T cells to enable controlled tissue plasticity - promoting adaptive changes
when needed while preventing excessive deviation from homeostatic baselines (Medzhitov &
Iwasaki, 2024). This concept helps explain how tissues maintain their identity while retaining
ability to adapt.

Plasticity enables not only homeostatic maintenance within normal physiological parameters but
also more profound adaptations when survival is at stake. In response to severe challenges,
organisms can temporarily override standard homeostatic mechanisms to establish new
functional baselines a process that manifests in immune responses, where acute inflammation
directly counters threats, and in physiological adaptation, where persistent challenges lead to
stable adjustments in homeostatic setpoints (Medzhitov, 2021). These adaptations beyond normal
homeostatic boundaries can be either beneficial, as in altitude acclimatisation, or potentially
harmful, as seen in chronic inflammatory conditions.

This hierarchical organisation of the system allows self-identity of its components via modular
architecture. For instance, cells maintain their fundamental identity while exhibiting controlled
plasticity in response to environmental signals. This modular architecture allows for both stability
(through core identity modules) and adaptability (through functional-demand modules). Cell
identity emerges through hierarchical transcriptional programs that integrate multiple regulatory
inputs. The core identity is maintained through lineage-specific transcription factors that control
fundamental cellular characteristics. This core program is supplemented by tissue-specific
modules that adapt cell function to local environments, and demand-responsive modules that
enable appropriate responses to specific challenges (Okabe & Medzhitov, 2016). For instance,
tissue-resident macrophages maintain their core identity through PU.1-dependent transcription
while adapting their function through tissue-specific transcriptional programs.

The persistence of identity, despite the continual turnover of cells, molecules and tissues, raises
the philosophical “Ship of Theseus” paradox: can an entity remain itself if all its components are
replaced over time? Biological systems resolve this by preserving organisational patterns and
information flows, not simply by retaining identical hardware. Stem cell divisions, for instance,
rebuild tissues in accordance with pre-existing spatial cues in the ECM, mechanical forces and
bioelectric fields. Damaged or dying cells release “find-me” signals (ATP, nucleotides, HMGB1,
CX3CL1) that recruit immune cells to clear debris and secrete factors guiding regeneration. This
ensures that the architecture and function of the tissue - rather than its exact cellular membership
remain constant.

This principle of maintained identity through dynamic replacement is well illustrated in neural
systems. Long-term memory persists despite continuous protein turnover, exemplified by the
maintenance of synaptic strength. Key proteins like PKMỹ, essential for memory maintenance,
are constantly degraded and replaced. However, the memory's structural basis endures through
persistent interactions between PKMỹ and the scaffolding protein KIBRA, which anchor
molecular processes supporting long-term potentiation at specific synapses (Tsokas et al., 2024).


[PAGE 13]
This creates a self-reinforcing system where the spatial pattern of synaptic connections is
preserved even as their molecular components are renewed.

Despite their resilience, these systems of dynamic stability have thresholds beyond which identity
fails. These critical transitions can occur when the rate of component loss exceeds replacement
capacity, when regulatory networks are overwhelmed, or when spatial information becomes
corrupted. For instance, severe tissue injury can disrupt the extracellular matrix scaffold and
bioelectric patterns that guide proper regeneration, leading to scarring rather than true
regeneration. Similarly, chronic inflammation can permanently alter tissue architecture through
sustained disruption of normal replacement patterns. Cancer similarly crosses this boundary:
gradual shifts in gene expression, metabolism and spatial organisation degrade a cell's original
identity, creating a self-reinforcing microenvironment that resists reversion to normal states.

Recognising these limits is important for therapeutic strategies and understanding how
manipulators push host systems past critical points. By establishing new stable equilibria, they
lock hosts into altered identities that prevent a return to the original state.

(5) Modularity and top-down control

While whole organisms exhibit behavioural intelligence, living systems are composed of a
hierarchical collection of dynamic agents that make context-sensitive decisions, learn from
experience, allocate resources, and solve novel problems (Fig. 1). Though less apparent at the
subcellular or tissue levels, these capacities are essential for adaptive functionality. Biological
subsystems - ranging from molecular to organism-level networks - function within defined
problem spaces to achieve adaptable homeostatic setpoints (the target conditions maintained by
the regulatory circuits that sustain life) (McMillen & Levin, 2024). Evolution likely repurposed
regulatory mechanisms for navigating diverse problem spaces including metabolic,
physiological, transcriptional, and anatomical domains – long before the specialised nervous
system emerged to support advanced cognitive functions and information processing (McMillen
& Levin, 2024; Levin, 2023c). In effect, all of these integrated systems - including the human
body as a whole – can be regarded as a form of collective intelligence, sustained by informational
and regulatory networks that synchronise the activities of individual components to achieve
emergent outcomes even though no single component explicitly represents the overall objective
(Levin, 2022; Levin, 2019).

A demonstration of adaptive self-organisation is the formation of a complex body during
embryogenesis. In most species, this process is not simply the inexorable emergence of
complexity from fixed biochemical rules, but rather an inherent capacity to achieve the species-
specific target morphologies despite variable conditions. As reviewed in detail elsewhere (Levin,
2023b; Levin, 2023c), morphogenesis demonstrates remarkable targeted plasticity in its ability
to reach consistent goal states despite radical variations in genome copy number, cell number,
cell size, scrambled starting configurations, injury, chimeric recombination, and physiology - a
phenomenon driven by the coordinated interplay of cellular regulatory networks (McMillen &
Levin, 2024). For instance, animals that develop eyes on their tails instead of their heads can
immediately adapt to visual input (Blackiston & Levin, 2013), bypassing the need for iterative
rounds of mutation and selection to adjust to a novel sensory-motor configuration. Likewise,
newts preserve their size and morphology by modulating cell number in response to the enlarged
cells resulting from polyploidy, employing distinct molecular mechanisms to achieve consistent

cells resulting from polyploidy, employing distinct molecular mechanisms to achieve consistent
anatomical outcomes despite differences in cellular composition (Fankhauser, 1945b;
Fankhauser, 1945a).
Some evidence suggests that morphogenesis can be modulated by top-down signals from various
sources, including parasites (Felt, 1940), neighbouring tissues (Gawne, McKenna & Levin, 2020)
and bioengineering interventions (Davies & Levin, 2023). This susceptibility arises because
morphogenesis is not a simple feed-forward process but is driven by a hierarchical network of
information-processing agents that coordinate cellular and tissue behaviour toward defined
outcomes (Levin, 2023a). Moreover, even subcellular networks adapt to overcome novel
challenges (Biswas, Clawson & Levin, 2022; Biswas et al., 2021; Stern et al., 2007; Stolovicki
et al., 2006; Katzir et al., 2012; Soen, Knafo & Elgart, 2015; Elgart, Snir & Soen, 2015; Csermely
et al., 2020).
This regulatory architecture provides modularity, evolvability, and robust adaptability in the face
of novelty; however, it is vulnerable to co-option. Biomedical advances can be achieved by
leveraging the inherent regulatory mechanisms of biological systems to develop interventions
that reset homeostatic setpoints and refine perception, memory and informational boundaries
(Lagasse & Levin, 2023; Levin, 2024a; Mathews et al., 2023). However, these ideas remain
predominantly conceptual, highlighting the need to develop simple quantitative models that
capture the key mechanisms and provide testable predictions, thus turning these concepts into a
solid empirical framework.

[PAGE 14] III. Mechanisms of biological hijacking
The manipulation of biological systems generally involves bypassing or overriding host
regulatory safeguards while minimising detection. These strategies exploit core biological
processes, blurring the boundaries between self and non-self, as well as between normal and
aberrant functions. Manipulators often utilise existing regulatory networks and leverage cellular
plasticity.

[PAGE 14] (1) Blueprint for host system subversion
To successfully manipulate a biological system, an intruder must execute a series of strategic
actions that exploit the host's vulnerabilities and utilise its regulatory mechanisms. In this chapter,
we outline the essential strategies for effective hijacking.

[PAGE 14] (a) Mimicry: imitating host systems
Mimicry involves producing or directly appropriating host or host-like molecules and structures
to evade immune detection and integrate into host processes. Metastatic cancer cells, for
example, adopt platelet-like signatures by incorporating platelet-derived glycoproteins, lipids
and MHC class I molecules onto their surfaces (Martins Castanheira et al., 2022; Schmied,
Höglund & Meinke, 2021). This “platelet cloaking” deceives immune surveillance by obtaining
a normal cell-like appearance, enhancing cancer cell survival and metastatic efficiency (Lim et
al., 2021; Spillane et al., 2021). Rove beetles similarly acquire ant cuticular hydrocarbons
through grooming, effectively adopting their chemical identity and enabling them to blend
seamlessly into ant colonies without rejection (Pires-Silva, Zilberman & Eloi, 2022). Pathogens
often use molecular mimicry. Vaccinia virus encodes the A49 protein, which mimics the host's
NF-kB inhibitor (Neidel et al., 2019). By imitating the structure and function of a host protein
that regulate inflammation, the virus suppresses the immune response, facilitating its survival
and replication.
Manipulators typically employ multiple complementary mimicry strategies that work
synergistically. Trophoblast cells in pregnancy represent perhaps the most successful example of
integrated mimicry. The trophoblast, derived from the fertilised egg, is a biological anomaly
both 'self' and 'non-self to the maternal organism due to its paternal antigens. This dual identity
allows it to drastically manipulate maternal tissues without triggering rejection. Through
endothelial and structural mimicry, the trophoblast transforms maternal spiral arteries to support
the growing fetus. It integrates into the arterial walls, replacing endothelial cells and adopting an
endothelial-like arrangement to remodel these vessels (Rai & Cross, 2014; Sung et al., 2022).
This structural mimicry allows the arteries to expand, accommodating increased blood flow - a
process essential for placental development. At the molecular level, to ensure endothelial
mimicry, trophoblast cells activate endothelial transcription factors, such as ERG, and produce
proteins like VE-cadherin and PECAM-1, enabling them to function as part of the vascular
system (Sung et al., 2022; Rai & Cross, 2014).


[PAGE 15] (b) Direct interference: internal sabotage
Manipulators can actively disrupt host systems rather than mimicking them. This approach
typically involves direct molecular interactions that block, modify, degrade or artificially activate
key host signalling components.
The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae blocks immune receptors by injecting
effector proteins into plant cells (Coburn, Sekirov & Finlay, 2007). Some of those effectors, such
as effector AvrPto, directly bind to and inhibit PRRs (Zong et al., 2008), preventing detection of
bacterial PAMPs. Other effectors indirectly influence receptor expression; for instance, effector
HopU1 blocks the interaction of their mRNAs with RNA-binding proteins associated with PRRs,
thereby reducing their levels. Another effector HopZ3 adds acetyl groups to host proteins,
contributing to immune evasion (Jeleńska et al., 2021).
The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US28 protein acts as a constitutively active G protein-
coupled receptor (GPCR) that can bind to a wide variety of chemokines and activate multiple
signalling pathways (such as phospholipase C, NF-κB, and MAP kinase pathways) without the
need for ligand binding (Vomaske, Nelson & Streblow, 2009; Daly, Smit & Plouffe, 2020).
Furthermore, US28-mediated enhancement of HIF-1 leads to increased proliferation,
angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming (de Wit et al., 2016). These HCMV US28 protein
activities generate aberrant signals that dysregulate host cell behaviour, thus establishing a pro-
viral environment (Daly et al., 2020; Krishna, Miller & O'Connor, 2018).
Epigenetic reprogramming is another potent form of direct interference, inducing heritable
changes in host gene expression. Cancer cells not only modify their own epigenetics but also
reprogram surrounding cells. By secreting cytokines, growth factors and exosomes with
regulatory microRNAs, they transform neighbouring stromal cells into cancer-associated
fibroblasts (Paggetti et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2023) and suppress immune genes via TGF-ẞ and
IL-10 (Labani-Motlagh, Ashja-Mahdavi & Loskog, 2020; Tie et al., 2022). Viruses similarly
exploit host epigenetic machinery - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins directly recruit DNA
methyltransferases and histone-modifying enzymes to silence tumour suppressor genes while
activating viral and pro-growth programs (Siouda et al., 2014; Tempera & Lieberman, 2014;
Saha et al., 2015; Kaneda et al., 2012). These epigenetic modifications create self-reinforcing
regulatory states that persist even after the initial triggering signals diminish.
Signal molecule degradation provides another direct interference strategy. Many bacterial
pathogens secrete enzymes that cleave antimicrobial factors (Hornef et al., 2002). Streptococcus
pyogenes produces streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB that cleaves multiple host proteins
including chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, disrupting both immune signalling and direct
antimicrobial defences (Barnett, Indraratna & Sanderson-Smith, 2022).
Physical barriers can also be undermined: Plasmodium falciparum restructure erythrocyte
membranes to ease nutrient acquisition (Counihan et al., 2017; Neveu & Lavazec, 2019), while
some bacteria produce pore-forming toxins that breach tissues and also neutralise immune cells
(Brito et al., 2019). Self-defecting agents likewise engage in structural interference: cancer cells
degrade the extracellular matrix via matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating invasion (Reunanen
& Kähäri, 2000-2013).
As direct disruption often triggers detection, manipulators employ strategies targeting either
specific pathways where detection can be minimised, or combining it with complementary
tactics, including immunosuppression and mimicry.

[PAGE 16] (c) Homeostatic reset: overriding normal limits
Effective manipulation often hinges on overriding homeostatic circuits to lock in new setpoints.
Homeostatic systems maintain physiological parameters within narrow ranges through layers of
negative feedback loops (Modell et al., 2015; Meizlish et al., 2021). Extreme deviations beyond
the homeostatic range - those that cannot be corrected by homeostatic circuits, including stress
responses - trigger inflammation (Meizlish et al., 2021; Kotas & Medzhitov, 2015), which serves
as a physiological 'circuit breaker', temporarily suspending normal regulatory constraints. This
inflammatory response drives major biological transitions by overriding homeostatic controls,
allowing tissue remodelling and cellular reprogramming (Kulkarni et al., 2016). Even processes
that appear non-inflammatory, such as developmental transitions and apoptosis, rely on
inflammatory signalling to initiate and coordinate systemic changes (Kolb et al., 2017; Collins,
Mitchell & Passegué, 2021; Newton et al., 2024). This inflammation-mediated circuit breaking
operates through multiple initiation pathways but aligns on shared inflammatory mechanisms to
achieve system reset and restore to its functional state, which may not necessarily be the initial
homeostatic range (Meizlish et al., 2021). Instead, it can establish a new homeostatic range if the
original is unachievable due to persistent changes or damage in the system, such as the continuous
presence of a manipulator.
Successful manipulating agents exploit these normal physiological mechanisms. Whether
triggered by the host's response to their presence or by existing tissue conditions, this
inflammatory "window" of suspended homeostatic control allows manipulators to establish new
set points that modify the host environment. For example, during early pregnancy, trophoblast
cells invade the maternal decidua during implantation, initiating an inflammatory phase that is
crucial for breaking the homeostatic circuit and overriding vascular homeostasis in maternal
spiral arteries (Dekel et al., 2014; Griffith et al., 2017; Stadtmauer & Wagner, 2020). As this

[PAGE 17] process progresses, trophoblast cells transition to an immunomodulatory role by expressing anti-
inflammatory mediators and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-L1, ensuring immune
tolerance (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). This inflammatory and immune-regulatory disruption
enables radical vessel remodelling, transforming narrow muscular arteries into wide, non-
contractile vessels that support placental development (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018).
Multiple pathways can initiate inflammatory circuit breaking. For instance, membrane potential
changes and ion fluxes activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Yang et al., 2019), while
calcium waves through gap junctions can initiate inflammatory cascades across connected tissues
(Fujii, Maekawa & Morita, 2017). Another example of inflammation initiation is metabolic
stress: ATP depletion, altered nutrient availability, or oxidative stress trigger inflammatory
responses through multiple mechanisms including inflammasome activation and stress kinase
signalling (Zhong et al., 2013). Mechanical disruption and tissue damage represent additional
triggers, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that initiate inflammatory
responses (Ma, Jiang & Zhou, 2024).
Cancer cells leverage inflammation as a circuit breaker to override normal tissue homeostasis. In
the initial disruption phase, cancer cells trigger inflammatory responses through multiple
mechanisms: oncogene activation, hypoxia, nutrient competition and mechanosensing (Abu, Rus
Bakarurraini & Nasir, 2021). Inflammatory cascades involving NF-kB and STAT3 then establish
altered metabolic and immune setpoints (e.g., via sustained IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-a release) (Wen
et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Hänggi et al., 2024). Tumours recruit regulatory immune cells
and promotes tumour-associated macrophages, which adopt an M2-like phenotype that support
tissue remodelling and maintain a supportive, immunosuppressive niche (Wen et al., 2022;
Turizo-Smith et al., 2024), locking the host into a new, cancer-facilitating equilibrium.
Understanding how manipulators achieve homeostatic transitions is highly valuable for medical
interventions and tissue engineering applications because offers two major capabilities. First,
being able to re-write homeostatic setpoints would enable top-down control of complex system-
level responses, allowing the use of low-complexity triggers rather than micromanaging every
endpoint. Second, targeting these setpoints could potentially yield a “cure” a stable reversion
to a healthy state that persists long after the intervention has ceased (currently durable
homeostatic shifts are rare, with few exceptions such as curative antimicrobials, certain surgical
interventions or select gene therapies).


[PAGE 17] (2) Redirecting regulatory pathways
The evolutionary arms race between hosts and manipulators has driven the development of
complex, redundant regulatory networks. Hosts develop overlapping control mechanisms to
maintain stability, while manipulators acquire strategies to bypass these barriers. This co-
evolution has shaped a wide range of biological control architectures, from redundant signalling
pathways to advanced neural circuits. More broadly, the ability to differentiate self-initiated
actions from external influences may have been crucial for the evolution of self-regulation and
agency, especially in lineages that later developed complex nervous systems (Moccia et al.,
2024).

changes and ion fluxes activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Yang et al., 2019), while

maintain stability, while manipulators acquire strategies to bypass these barriers. This co-
evolution has shaped a wide range of biological control architectures, from redundant signalling
pathways to advanced neural circuits. More broadly, the ability to differentiate self-initiated
actions from external influences may have been crucial for the evolution of self-regulation and
agency, especially in lineages that later developed complex nervous systems (Moccia et al.,
2024).

[PAGE 17] (a) Immune evasion and suppression
The immune system is often the first and most imposing obstacle for any manipulator because it
distinguishes self from non-self and conducts both local and systemic defensive measures. Its
centrality in maintaining organismal identity forces intruders to evolve methods that weaken
immune vigilance or redirect it for their benefit.
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) form the first line of defence, monitoring both external and
internal environments for signs of threat or damage. These include toll-like receptors (TLR) that
detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns, NOD-like receptors that monitor intracellular
spaces, and various danger signal receptors that identify tissue damage and cellular stress.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis faces multiple pattern recognition receptors including TLR2, TLR4,
and NOD2 that detect bacterial cell wall components and other conserved bacterial molecules
(Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2011). The bacterium overcomes these recognition systems by modifying
its surface lipids, masking key molecular patterns, and actively interfering with receptor
signalling pathways through secreted effector proteins that prevent proper immune detection
(Jacobo-Delgado et al., 2023; Day et al., 2014; Blanc et al., 2017; Drennan et al., 2004).
Beyond innate recognition, the adaptive immune machinery presents increasingly advanced
barriers that must be overcome. Trypanosomes undergo antigenic variation, constantly changing
their surface coat glycoproteins to avoid antibody recognition (Glover et al., 2013; Morrison,
Marcello & McCulloch, 2009). Each switch creates a new surface identity, allowing the parasite
population to persist despite host adaptive immune responses. Cancer cells exemplify more
comprehensive immune reprogramming. Rather than being eliminated by tissue-resident
macrophages, they convert these sentinels into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) through
secretion of cytokines such as CSF-1 and CCL2 (Liu et al., 2021; Mantovani et al., 2022;
DeNardo & Ruffell, 2019; Savage, 2024; Kuratani et al., 2024). These macrophages adopt an
M2-like phenotype that supports cancer progression, along with driving regulatory T cell
induction. Meanwhile, cancer cells downregulate MHC class I expression (Cornel, Mimpen &
Nierkens, 2020; Liu et al., 2019), shed NKG2D ligands, and upregulate 'don't eat me' signals
such as CD47 (Lian et al., 2019). They also release immunosuppressive factors including IL-10
and TGF-ẞ, and induce metabolic remodelling to deplete nutrients in the tumour
microenvironment (Labani-Motlagh et al., 2020; Scott et al., 2021; Lim, Rathmell & Rathmell,
2020). These steps form an immunosuppressive niche that supports further tumour growth,
angiogenesis and metastasis.
During pregnancy, trophoblast cells demonstrate immune tolerance despite expressing paternal
antigens that should trigger rejection (Moffett & Shreeve, 2023; Tirado-González et al., 2013).
Extravillous trophoblast - the cells that invade into the mother's tissues - evade immune detection
by lacking HLA-A and HLA-B whilst expressing HLA-G, which suppresses T cells and
modulates the function of natural killer (NK) and antigen-presenting cells towards a tolerogenic
phenotype. The trophoblast expresses PDL1 and PDL2 to induce T cell exhaustion and
suppression, whilst secreting immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory factors such as
prostaglandin E2, 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), IL-10, and TGFẞ (Carvajal et al., 2021; Xu et al.,
2021; Moffett & Shreeve, 2023). Additionally, the trophoblast utilises domesticated viral
elements, particularly syncytin proteins from endogenous retroviruses, which facilitate
syncytiotrophoblast formation and provide immunosuppression (Mangeney et al., 2007). These
ancient viral sequences, now permanently integrated into mammalian genomes, serve as
regulatory elements for placental development genes, demonstrating how viral machinery has
been repurposed for tissue manipulation (Mi et al., 2000; Imakawa et al., 2022).
An extreme illustration of immune surveillance's importance is a case in which a tapeworm
(Hymenolepis nana) developed malignant growths within a host with advanced AIDS
(Muehlenbachs et al., 2015). The severe CD4+ T cell depletion allowed the tapeworm cells to
proliferate within host tissues, forming metastatic tumours. This case demonstrate that, in the
absence of functional immune barriers, tumour cells from even phylogenetically distant
organisms can proliferate and establish themselves within the host.
Manipulators bombard the immune system on multiple fronts: disguising themselves with host-
like proteins, disabling antigen presentation, degrading pro-inflammatory mediators, secreting
immunomodulatory signals, or hijacking checkpoint ligands that regulate immune cells, thereby
dampening the very cascades meant to destroy them. By selectively disengaging these regulatory
loops, intruders transform protective defences into permissive niches, ensuring their persistence
despite a robust, multilayered immune architecture.

[PAGE 19] (b) Neural system manipulation: altering behaviour and physiological control
The neural system is a prime target for manipulation because it integrates multi-scale information
to coordinate behaviour, physiology and organism-wide homeostasis. Its hierarchical structure,
extending from synapses to complex circuits, enables intruders to exert broad control once they
infiltrate critical neural hubs. An example of direct neural manipulation is the jewel wasp

Ampulex compressa, which controls cockroaches, turning them into living food sources for its
larvae. To do so the wasp must overcome the cockroach's central complex, a brain region
controlling motor function and behaviour. The wasp injects venom containing GABA, ẞ-alanine
and taurine directly into the cockroach's central complex brain region, inducing temporary leg
paralysis and facilitating guided locomotion (Haspel, Rosenberg & Libersat, 2003; Gal et al.,
2014). Dopamine release via D1-like receptors then triggers grooming behaviour followed by a
hypokinetic state, ensuring the cockroach remains alive yet compliant until the wasp's larvae
emerge (Nordio et al., 2022; Gal & Libersat, 2010). Rather than evolving novel molecules, the
wasp exploits standard neurotransmitters to hijack existing circuits.
Other manipulators create parallel regulatory systems. The parasitic barnacle Sacculina carcini
persists for the host's lifespan by extending rootlets into a crab's ventral ganglia and other neural
tissues. These rootlets modify their shape and structure to establish intimate contact with the
host's nervous system, resulting a high degree of control, akin to a parallel regulatory system.
The rootlets modulate host's neural signalling, causing reduced aggression, gonadal degeneration
and care of Sacculina's external reproductive structures (Miroliubov et al., 2020; Lianguzova et
al., 2023; Campos et al., 2022). Although precise mechanisms are not fully described, serotonin-
positive cells around the rootlets suggests that Sacculina may indirectly influence serotonin levels
by changes in neurotransmitter receptor activity or the modulation of serotonin transport and
release from nearby neurons (Miroliubov et al., 2020; Lianguzova et al., 2023).
A related but more complex example is the fungal pathogen Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu
lato, which infiltrates various tissues of its host, carpenter ants, including muscles and
haemolymph, and establishes an extensive network enabling mechanical control of ant
movements (de Bekker & Das, 2022). Infected ants leave their colonies and climb vegetation at
specific times conducive to fungal spore dispersal. Recent research suggests that this
manipulation involves overriding the ant's normal circadian clock, with the host's daily rhythms
disappearing during infection as the fungus imposes its timing for behavioural manipulation (de
Bekker, Beckerson & Elya, 2021; Will et al., 2020; Will, Attardo & de Bekker, 2023). The
manipulation involves replacing host muscle fibres, secreting molecules that affect
dopaminergic, serotonergic and octopaminergic signalling, and expressing effector proteins
(such as protein tyrosine phosphatases), that can potentially bind to ant proteins involved in
circadian rhythm regulation (de Bekker & Das, 2022; Will et al., 2023). The fungus appears to
have its own light-responsive clock, synchronizing daily expression of key manipulation genes
(de Bekker et al., 2014).
Toxoplasma gondii has evolved a remarkable ability to manipulate its host's behaviour,
potentially enhancing transmission success to its definitive feline host. This neurotropic parasite
elevate dopamine in infected neural cells, which results in various behavioural alterations,
including decreased aversion to cat odour, increased exploratory behaviour, and impaired
prepulse inhibition response, which might affect the host's risk assessment and behaviour,
particularly impaired fear memory and altered stress responses (Mahmoud, Fereig & Nishikawa,
2017; Mahmoud et al., 2016; Ihara et al., 2016). These changes potentially may increase the risk
of predation by cats.
Breast and prostate cancers also manipulate neural systems to aid survival, particularly when
metastasizing to bone. (Le et al., 2022; Silverman et al., 2021). They secrete neurotrophic factors
such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, prompting aberrant nerve
sprouting that benefits tumour progression and their ability to spread. Additionally, metastatic
cells upregulate receptors for neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related
peptide, enabling them to respond to neural signals in ways that promote their survival and
proliferation. In breast cancer specifically, tumour cells stimulate spontaneous calcium activity
in sensory neurons, triggering substance P release, which then binds tachykinin receptors on
tumour cells and drives metastasis (Padmanaban et al., 2024).
Neural hijackers commonly exploit existing neurotransmitters, receptors or high-level circuit
nodes to induce systemic shifts in host behaviour and physiology. By targeting these highly
conserved mechanisms, they leverage the host's own molecular language to reprogram neural
functions. Intruders often identify circuit 'super-nodes' (for example, brain regions integrating
motor control or stress responses) whose manipulation yields broad downstream effects, inducing
striking phenotypic outcomes through minimal genetic and biochemical modifications. Bridging
neural signals with other systemic networks (immune, endocrine, metabolic), amplifying the
scope of control. Additionally, there is evidence that some hijackers can sense and respond to
neural electrical cues - for instance, herpes simplex virus type 1 senses neuronal hyperexcitability
to time its reactivation when conditions in the cell (and perhaps the broader microenvironment)
are favourable for productive infection (Cuddy et al., 2020).


[PAGE 20] (c) Endocrine system: hijacking long-range signalling
The endocrine system is a prime target for biological manipulation due to its role in coordinating
organism-wide responses and its capacity for long-range communication and regulation of
development, metabolism, immune responses, reproduction and behaviour. Manipulators can
produce hormone analogues, alter hormone production and reception, or hijack hormone-
dependent developmental programmes.
Developmental hormone axes are particularly attractive targets because of profound influence on
organismal physiology. Wolbachia infections in terrestrial isopods (woodlice) disrupt the
androgenic gland hormone (AGH), which governs male sexual differentiation. By suppressing
AGH, Wolbachia feminises genetic males and skews the population's sex ratio, enhancing the
bacterium's transmission through the maternal line (Herran et al., 2021; Herran et al., 2020).
Plant pathogens also exploit hormonal systems. Pseudomonas syringae synthesises coronatine,
a mimic of the plant hormone jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which binds jasmonate receptors
with higher affinity than JA-Ile. By outcompeting the native hormone, coronatine compromises
salicylic acid-dependent immune pathways essential for plant defence (Zheng et al., 2012).
The trophoblast illustrates how endocrine manipulation achieves precise temporal control over
host physiology. Embryo-derived syncytiotrophoblast cells secrete hormones - including human
chorionic gonadotropin, placental growth hormone, human placental lactogen, and corticotropin-
releasing hormone (CRH) - that reprogram maternal physiology (Malassiné, Frendo & Evain-
Brion, 2003; Handwerger & Freemark, 2000). They override maternal metabolic regulation to
increase fetal glucose availability, remodel cardiovascular function to enhance blood flow, and
modify immune responses to prevent fetal rejection (Barbour et al., 2007; Sanghavi &
Rutherford, 2014; Arck & Hecher, 2013). The placenta also becomes a major source of estrogen
and progesterone, elevating prolactin and oxytocin production (Grattan & Kokay, 2008). This
fosters maternal care and moderates stress responses, effectively hijacking maternal behaviour
to favour the fetus (Brunton & Russell, 2008). Placental CRH creates a positive feedback loop
that differs from typical negative feedback in the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
leading to progressively rising hormone levels that help time labour onset (Smith, 2007).
Although initiated locally, this manipulation achieves systemic effects through existing
endocrine networks, demonstrating how hormone signalling coordinates physiological,
metabolic, and behavioural changes across multiple organ systems.
The effectiveness of endocrine manipulation arises from several key principles: hormones
amplify local signals into systemic responses, hormonal networks contain multiple reinforcing
feedback loops that can be leveraged, and endocrine signalling integrates with other regulatory
systems, including immune and neural networks.

[PAGE 21] (d) Metabolic system: redirecting resource allocation
The metabolic system is a target for manipulation owing to its central role in energy production,
resource allocation and cellular homeostasis. There main tactics drive this manipulation:
overriding nutrient sensing, reprogramming metabolic networks and establishing privileged
resource access.
Nutrient-sensing override allows manipulators to maintain resource acquisition despite host
regulatory signals that would normally restrict uptake. Cancer cells achieve this through
constitutive mTOR signalling activation and suppression of AMPK-dependent metabolic
checkpoints, enabling continued growth under nutrient-limited conditions (Magaway, Kim &
Jacinto, 2019; Keerthana et al., 2023). This override extends beyond individual cells; tumours
establish restrictive microenvironments that deprive immune cells while channelling nutrients to
themselves (Keerthana et al., 2023).
Toxoplasma gondii reprograms host cell metabolism by altering oxidative states, mitochondrial
function, and various metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and arginine
metabolism (Gallego-López et al., 2023; Hargrave et al., 2019). These metabolic changes support
the parasite's growth and survival within diverse host cell environments.

[PAGE 21] 
AGH, Wolbachia feminises genetic males and skews the population's sex ratio, enhancing the
bacterium's transmission through the maternal line (Herran et al., 2021; Herran et al., 2020).
Plant pathogens also exploit hormonal systems. Pseudomonas syringae synthesises coronatine,
a mimic of the plant hormone jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which binds jasmonate receptors
with higher affinity than JA-Ile. By outcompeting the native hormone, coronatine compromises
salicylic acid-dependent immune pathways essential for plant defence (Zheng et al., 2012).
The trophoblast illustrates how endocrine manipulation achieves precise temporal control over
host physiology. Embryo-derived syncytiotrophoblast cells secrete hormones - including human
chorionic gonadotropin, placental growth hormone, human placental lactogen, and corticotropin-
releasing hormone (CRH) - that reprogram maternal physiology (Malassiné, Frendo & Evain-
Brion, 2003; Handwerger & Freemark, 2000). They override maternal metabolic regulation to
increase fetal glucose availability, remodel cardiovascular function to enhance blood flow, and
modify immune responses to prevent fetal rejection (Barbour et al., 2007; Sanghavi &
Rutherford, 2014; Arck & Hecher, 2013). The placenta also becomes a major source of estrogen
and progesterone, elevating prolactin and oxytocin production (Grattan & Kokay, 2008). This
fosters maternal care and moderates stress responses, effectively hijacking maternal behaviour
to favour the fetus (Brunton & Russell, 2008). Placental CRH creates a positive feedback loop
that differs from typical negative feedback in the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
leading to progressively rising hormone levels that help time labour onset (Smith, 2007).
Although initiated locally, this manipulation achieves systemic effects through existing
endocrine networks, demonstrating how hormone signalling coordinates physiological,
metabolic, and behavioural changes across multiple organ systems.
The effectiveness of endocrine manipulation arises from several key principles: hormones
amplify local signals into systemic responses, hormonal networks contain multiple reinforcing
feedback loops that can be leveraged, and endocrine signalling integrates with other regulatory
systems, including immune and neural networks.

(d) Metabolic system: redirecting resource allocation
The metabolic system is a target for manipulation owing to its central role in energy production,
resource allocation and cellular homeostasis. There main tactics drive this manipulation:
overriding nutrient sensing, reprogramming metabolic networks and establishing privileged
resource access.
Nutrient-sensing override allows manipulators to maintain resource acquisition despite host
regulatory signals that would normally restrict uptake. Cancer cells achieve this through
constitutive mTOR signalling activation and suppression of AMPK-dependent metabolic
checkpoints, enabling continued growth under nutrient-limited conditions (Magaway, Kim &
Jacinto, 2019; Keerthana et al., 2023). This override extends beyond individual cells; tumours
establish restrictive microenvironments that deprive immune cells while channelling nutrients to
themselves (Keerthana et al., 2023).
Toxoplasma gondii reprograms host cell metabolism by altering oxidative states, mitochondrial
function, and various metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and arginine
metabolism (Gallego-López et al., 2023; Hargrave et al., 2019). These metabolic changes support
the parasite's growth and survival within diverse host cell environments.


[PAGE 22]
Privileged resource access often develops through structural and functional modifications that
allow manipulators to secure nutrients at the expense of over host tissues. The parasitic plant
Striga hermonthica establishes vascular connections with host plants via a specialized organ
called the haustorium, enabling direct access to host nutrients via alteration of multiple host plant
hormones (abscisic and gibberellic acids) and the host's developmental programmes (Aoki et al.,
2022; Jamil et al., 2024; Yap & Tsuchiya, 2023). Similarly, in human pregnancy, trophoblasts
transform maternal spiral arteries into high-velocity, low-resistance vessels that facilitate
sufficient blood flow into the placenta (Abbas et al., 2020).
The metabolic manipulations typically operate in tandem with modifications of other regulatory
networks such as developmental, immune and endocrine. By integrating metabolic changes with
other regulatory networks, intruders maintain stable, long-term resource redirection without
fatally disrupting essential host functions.

(e) Developmental reactivation: unmasking latent pathways
Many developmental pathways remain latent activation potential despite being tightly regulated
after organogenesis. Manipulators exploit this developmental plasticity by either reactivating
silenced embryonic programmes or hijacking active developmental pathways that control tissue
maintenance and regeneration. By interfering with these fundamental mechanisms of tissue
organisation and morphogenesis, intruders can coordinate complex cellular behaviours to
remodel host tissues for their benefit.
Phytoplasmas illustrates how key developmental regulators can be harnessed. Their effector
protein SAP54 interferes with floral development by forming a complex with MADS-box
transcription factors and proteasomal shuttle factors, directing these essential developmental
factors for degradation via the 26S proteasome (Teo, Zhou & Shen, 2019; Saavedra Núñez,
González-Villanueva & Ramos, 2023; Kitazawa et al., 2023). This disruption transforms normal
floral development into leaf-like structures (phyllody), fundamentally altering organ identity and
converting reproductive tissue into vegetative tissue that provides nutrients and space for
phytoplasma proliferation.
The trophoblast exemplifies precise developmental reactivation during placentation. Trophoblast
cells induce controlled changes in vascular smooth muscle cells of maternal spiral arteries,
reactivating developmental programmes that enable radical vessel remodelling. This process
involves coordinated activation of multiple pathways, including Notch signalling and vascular
morphogenesis programmes, transforming narrow muscular arteries into dilated vessels
optimised for placental perfusion (Cuman et al., 2014; Perlman et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022).
Self-defecting agents frequently exploit developmental pathway reactivation. Cancer cells revive
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programmes through transcription factors like SNAIL
and TWIST, acquiring invasive properties normally restricted to embryogenesis. This
reactivation enables cells to break free from epithelial constraints while suppressing cellular
senescence pathways (Mierke, 2019; Ko et al., 2018). Similarly, many aggressive tumours
reactivate neural crest-associated programmes, expressing molecules like NCAM, that facilitates
cell-cell adhesion and migration (Amoureux et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011).


[PAGE 23]
Developmental manipulation usually involves coordinated activation of multiple pathways rather
than single-gene effects. By harnessing these extensive regulatory networks, manipulators
recapitulate aspects of embryonic development to remodel tissues. This capacity to reactivate
developmental programmes with controlled tissue organisation suggests potential therapeutic
strategies in regenerative medicine and anti-cancer interventions aimed at modulating cellular
plasticity.

(f) Integration: multi-system attack
The evolutionary arms race between hosts and manipulators drives increasing complexity in
biological control networks. As hosts evolve layered defences, manipulators must develop
correspondingly integrated strategies to override these barriers. This recursive process has shaped
both host regulatory architecture - from redundant signalling pathways to interwoven neural
circuits - and manipulator attack strategies. Rather than targeting isolated pathways, manipulators
coordinate interventions across immune, neural, endocrine, metabolic and developmental
networks, overwhelming compensatory responses. The parasitic wasp Cotesia congregata
exemplifies such multi-level manipulation in caterpillar Manduca sexta by injecting its eggs,
venom, teratocytes and a symbiotic bracovirus (Cotesia congregata bracovirus, CcBV) into the
caterpillar, thereby taking comprehensive control over its physiology:
1) The bracovirus is integrated into the wasp genome and amplified specifically in the wasp
ovaries, where it is then packaged into viral particles and injected into the caterpillar
(Louis et al., 2013; Chevignon et al., 2018; Bézier et al., 2013). CcBV suppresses the
host's immune response, allowing the wasp larvae to develop safely. Viral cystatins inhibit
caterpillar proteases, diverting resources to the larvae and arresting caterpillar's pupation
that would otherwise disrupt larval survival (Espagne et al., 2005).
2) While the venom components are not detailed extensively, they synergise with CcBV to
suppress both immune responses and host development (Moreau & Asgari, 2015).
3) Larvae feed on the caterpillar's haemolymph and, as they develop, they chew their way
out of the caterpillar to spin cocoons on its surface. Emerging larvae secrete factors such
as plasmatocyte spreading peptide (a cytokine) and spätzle (a Toll receptor ligand), which
are involved in cytokine signalling and activation of the immune response. The cytokine
storm induces sickness behaviour as well as a stress response, elevating neurohormonal
mediators like octopamine (a vertebrate noradrenaline analogue). These changes trigger
specific behavioural alterations in the host: the caterpillar ceases feeding and spontaneous
movement, thereby preventing it from harming or consuming the wasp larvae (Adamo et
al., 2016; Miles & Booker, 2000). However, the caterpillar's defensive responses remain
partially intact, enabling it to respond aggressively when disturbed. This behaviour
protects the wasp cocoons from predators and is often referred to as “bodyguard
manipulation."
4) Teratocytes are specialized cells that form a membrane around wasp eggs and are released
into the host once the eggs hatch. These cells secrete various immunoregulatory factors
and hormones that manipulate host development, modulate immune system, and alter
metabolism. For instance, cysteine-rich proteins inhibit the synthesis of host storage
proteins, thereby freeing up resources for the developing wasp larvae. Teratocytes also
directly modify host nutrition by attaching to and digesting fat body tissue (Gao et al.,
2016; Nakamatsu & Tanaka, 2004).
This multi-component strategy achieves precise temporal control over host biology by exploiting
the inherent connections between regulatory systems. The wasp effectively converts the
caterpillar into a 'nursery' for its offspring through coordinated manipulation of immune,
neuroendocrine, metabolic and developmental pathways.


[PAGE 24]
Another example of integrated manipulation is plant gall formation induced by insects, which
reveals remarkable morphogenetic competency in cells that normally produce the same pattern
with high reliability. For instance, aphids transform plant tissues into highly organised structures
that provide both shelter and nutrition. The gall-inducing process involves precise delivering
effector molecules into individual plant cells via specialized mouthparts (stylets). This cell-by-
cell manipulation accomplishes a targeted reprogramming of plant gene expression through the
continuous release of effectors proteins, phytohormones and signalling molecules - that
modulate transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks (Holland et al., 2023; Kutsukake,
Uematsu & Fukatsu, 2019). Removal of the insect arrests gall development, that ongoing insect-
host interactions are essential for gall formation:
1) Aphids deliver effectors that induce profound changes in plant cellular organisation. Plant
cells near stylet injection sites undergo enhanced proliferation, involving periclinal
divisions a pattern not observed in normal leaf development (Korgaonkar et al., 2021;
Holland et al., 2023). These changes involve reorganisation of subcellular structures and
establishment of new developmental trajectories.
2) Aphids upregulate plant genes involved in nutrient transport and metabolism while
suppressing photosynthetic pathways, thereby creating a privileged feeding site enriched
in amino acid and sugars to sustain colony (Kutsukake et al., 2019).
3) Aphids secrete diverse effector proteins that alter plant developmental programmes. One
example is the BICYCLE protein family, which interferes with plant development and
immune signalling, altering plant morphology to optimise it for aphid survival
(Korgaonkar et al., 2021; Holland et al., 2023). Various BICYCLE proteins appear to
target distinct aspects of plant biology and exhibit precise temporal regulation during gall
formation. Different aphid species induce distinct gall morphologies, indicating precise
control over plant development rather than random tissue overgrowth.
4) Gall formation requires sustained suppression of host defences. Aphids secrete effectors
that interfere with plant immune signalling, preventing the activation of defence
responses that normally restrict tissue transformation (Liu et al., 2024; Gravino et al.,
2024).
5) The galls display remarkably specialized architectures that maintain a favourable
microenvironment for aphid development. They contain nutritive tissues, modified
vascular patterns and structural features that regulate internal environmental conditions
(Kutsukake et al., 2019; Korgaonkar et al., 2021; Holland et al., 2023). The consistent
gall morphology seen within each aphid species, even across different plant hosts,
demonstrates the precision of multi-system manipulation.
The precision with which manipulators align diverse host pathways reflects the same complex
coordination that supports normal developmental transitions, from embryogenesis to
metamorphosis.


[PAGE 25]
(3) The recipe for hijackers: a unified model of hijacking principles
Throughout this paper, we have explored the strategies used by biological manipulators to hijack
host systems. Below is a summary of the essential steps required to hijack a biological system
(Fig. 2).
1. Breach and anchor. Intruders first bypass or weaken the host's physical and chemical
barriers to enter into the system (Fig. 2A). Cellular invasion often involves exploiting
existing receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways or directly modifying membrane
properties. For example, Plasmodium falciparum uses adhesins and proteases to breach
the erythrocyte membrane, reorganising membrane lipids to establish a parasitophorous
vacuole for intracellular survival (Mukherjee et al., 2022; Triglia et al., 2023; Geoghegan
et al., 2021). At tissue levels, manipulators degrade basement membranes and disrupt
tight junctions, often by secreting matrix metalloproteinases or hijacking host cell
migration machinery.
2. Disguise as self to evade detection and neutralise the host's defence to prevent
elimination. Once inside, manipulators adopt molecular and structural characteristics that
mimic the host's own components, camouflaging their identity to avoid triggering
immune surveillance (Fig. 2B). For example, breast cancer cells can colonise bone tissue
by activating osteomimetic transcription factors such as Runx2, adopting an osteoblast-
like phenotype and integrating into the bone microenvironment (Barnes et al., 2003; Tan
et al., 2016). Additionally, as extensively discussed in previous chapters,
immunosuppression is a very important component of biological system hijacking. By
blunting or misdirecting defensive host responses, intruders can maintain control with
minimal opposition.
3. Shatter homeostatic controls. Biological systems rely on complex regulatory networks
that coordinate processes across multiple scales. These networks incorporate numerous
feedback loops, redundant pathways and hierarchical control structures that have evolved
to maintain homeostasis and identity. Manipulating agents must overcome these robust
control architectures to achieve their objectives. By pushing physiological parameters far
beyond normal ranges, the host's homeostatic balance becomes disrupted (Fig. 2C),
inducing inflammatory responses that temporarily suspend regulatory controls (Kotas &
Medzhitov, 2015; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Kolb et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2021; Newton
et al., 2024). This temporary suspension allows manipulators to reset setpoints,
establishing new norms and permitting actions previously restricted - such as the
reactivation of dormant developmental pathways or differentiation processes to remodel
tissues and alter cellular functions. By exploiting the host's capacity for change
(plasticity), intruders can induce transformations that favour their persistence.
4. Seize communication and reprogramming regulatory networks. Communication is
central to biological systems - from molecular signals within cells and bioelectrical
signals between cells to long-range hormonal signalling – communication coordinates
cellular behaviours, tissue homeostasis and organismal level responses to environmental
changes. Communication networks that emerged with increasing biological complexity
lack the evolutionary-derived robustness of more ancient processes, as the new
mechanisms accumulated less redundancy. In multicellular tissues, cells rely on
collective resilience through shared stress responses, metabolic cooperation and
coordinated defences. Once these communication networks are disrupted (Fig. 2D),
individual cells become isolated from protective mechanisms, leaving them susceptible
to further manipulation. Intruders employ three main strategies:
Block or disrupt existing signals by directly interfering with signal molecules, their
receptors, or downstream pathways. Cancer cells, for example, alter gap junctions
and surface adhesion molecules (Ugur et al., 2022; Wilczyński et al., 2024), thus,
disrupting tissue architecture and cell-cell communication.
Produce mimics of host signalling molecules to generate false messages. For
instance, the human cytomegalovirus protein US28 acts as a constitutively active G

[PAGE 25] 
properties. For example, Plasmodium falciparum uses adhesins and proteases to breach
the erythrocyte membrane, reorganising membrane lipids to establish a parasitophorous
vacuole for intracellular survival (Mukherjee et al., 2022; Triglia et al., 2023; Geoghegan
et al., 2021). At tissue levels, manipulators degrade basement membranes and disrupt
tight junctions, often by secreting matrix metalloproteinases or hijacking host cell
migration machinery.

2. Disguise as self to evade detection and neutralise the host's defence to prevent
elimination. Once inside, manipulators adopt molecular and structural characteristics that
mimic the host's own components, camouflaging their identity to avoid triggering
immune surveillance (Fig. 2B). For example, breast cancer cells can colonise bone tissue
by activating osteomimetic transcription factors such as Runx2, adopting an osteoblast-
like phenotype and integrating into the bone microenvironment (Barnes et al., 2003; Tan
et al., 2016). Additionally, as extensively discussed in previous chapters,
immunosuppression is a very important component of biological system hijacking. By
blunting or misdirecting defensive host responses, intruders can maintain control with
minimal opposition.

3. Shatter homeostatic controls. Biological systems rely on complex regulatory networks
that coordinate processes across multiple scales. These networks incorporate numerous
feedback loops, redundant pathways and hierarchical control structures that have evolved
to maintain homeostasis and identity. Manipulating agents must overcome these robust
control architectures to achieve their objectives. By pushing physiological parameters far
beyond normal ranges, the host's homeostatic balance becomes disrupted (Fig. 2C),
inducing inflammatory responses that temporarily suspend regulatory controls (Kotas &
Medzhitov, 2015; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Kolb et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2021; Newton
et al., 2024). This temporary suspension allows manipulators to reset setpoints,
establishing new norms and permitting actions previously restricted - such as the
reactivation of dormant developmental pathways or differentiation processes to remodel
tissues and alter cellular functions. By exploiting the host's capacity for change
(plasticity), intruders can induce transformations that favour their persistence.

4. Seize communication and reprogramming regulatory networks. Communication is
central to biological systems - from molecular signals within cells and bioelectrical
signals between cells to long-range hormonal signalling – communication coordinates
cellular behaviours, tissue homeostasis and organismal level responses to environmental
changes. Communication networks that emerged with increasing biological complexity
lack the evolutionary-derived robustness of more ancient processes, as the new
mechanisms accumulated less redundancy. In multicellular tissues, cells rely on
collective resilience through shared stress responses, metabolic cooperation and
coordinated defences. Once these communication networks are disrupted (Fig. 2D),
individual cells become isolated from protective mechanisms, leaving them susceptible
to further manipulation. Intruders employ three main strategies:
Block or disrupt existing signals by directly interfering with signal molecules, their
receptors, or downstream pathways. Cancer cells, for example, alter gap junctions
and surface adhesion molecules (Ugur et al., 2022; Wilczyński et al., 2024), thus,
disrupting tissue architecture and cell-cell communication.
Produce mimics of host signalling molecules to generate false messages. For
instance, the human cytomegalovirus protein US28 acts as a constitutively active G

[PAGE 26]
protein-coupled receptor that generates aberrant signals under the facade of
legitimate host signalling, dysregulating host cell behaviour (Krishna et al., 2018).
Establish new communication channels while isolating themselves from host control
signals. By creating aberrant signalling environments, cancer cells coordinate tumour
growth while remaining functionally detached from normal tissue regulation (Zhang
et al., 2016; Aramini et al., 2022).

Rather than evolving entirely novel pathways, manipulators typically exploit the host's
existing regulatory architecture, taking advantage of biological plasticity. Network
reprogramming follows three main patterns:
Pathway rewiring. Intruders modify protein-protein interactions, change
spatiotemporal signalling dynamics or alter pathway crosstalk to redirect information
flow. Many plant pathogens, including Pseudomonas syringae, secrete effectors that
rewire host immune signalling networks by disrupting specific protein interactions
or redirecting signals through alternative pathways (Toruño, Stergiopoulos &
Coaker, 2016; Guo et al., 2009).
- Control node hijacking. By targeting key regulatory hubs such as transcription factors
or epigenetic regulators, manipulators induce broad changes in gene expression.
Cancer cells, for example, exploit HIF-1a to synchronise metabolic reprogramming,
angiogenesis and immune evasion (Infantino et al., 2021; Corcoran & O'Neill, 2016;
Sharma, Sinha & Shrivastava, 2022).
Feedback loop modification. This involves introducing new feedback connections,
dismantling existing loops or altering their dynamics. During placental development,
trophoblast cells form new regulatory loops that sustain their invasive phenotype
whilst preventing excessive invasion. These loops include positive feedback circuits
that reinforce developmental programmes and negative feedback mechanisms that
limit uncontrolled growth (Lu et al., 2013; Knöfler & Pollheimer, 2013).

5. Engineer physical space. Intruders manipulate the physical organisation of host tissues to
create niches that support their survival (Fig. 2E). This involves remodelling the
extracellular matrix, modifying mechanical properties and reorganising tissue
architecture. By degrading matrix components, manipulators gain access to essential
nutrients and evade host defences. Changes in the physical properties of the tissue, such
as stiffness or elasticity, can enhance invasive potential and promote survival in hostile
environments. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the abundant stromal components
not only support tumour growth but also impede the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs
and shield cancer cells from immune surveillance (Perez, Kearney & Yeh, 2021; Thomas
& Radhakrishnan, 2019; Bulle & Lim, 2020; Du et al., 2023).

6. Establish long-term control. To maintain sustained manipulation, intruders implement
changes that that remain even after initial triggers are gone (Fig. 2F). These changes often
include epigenetic modifications that reprogram host gene expression to favour their
persistence. Some manipulators integrate their genetic material directly into the host
genome, creating a permanent blueprint for their continued replication, as seen with
oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus (HPV), whose viral oncogenes disrupt
normal cellular function and promote malignancy (Warburton et al., 2021; Lehoux,
D'Abramo & Archambault, 2009). Others establish self-sustaining feedback loops that
maintain manipulated states without further external input. By synchronizing diverse
mechanisms and actions, intruders can persist undetected within the host system,
revealing potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.


[PAGE 28]
Biological manipulation synchronises diverse mechanisms and actions, enabling intruders to
persist undetected within the host system. In the next chapter, we examine how leveraging or
counteracting these same principles could guide new therapeutic strategies and engineered
solutions inspired by nature's own methods of manipulation. Although this framework brings
together many observed phenomena, it leaves open questions about which mechanisms are most
critical and how they can be measured. Future studies should focus on these key aspects with
controlled experiments to validate and refine our framework.

[PAGE 28]
IV. Engineered interventions inspired by natural manipulation

Manipulators achieve lasting control over their hosts by reprogramming physiology, remodelling
tissues and establishing new setpoints. Insights from these biological strategies can be used to
develop interventions that steer diseased tissues toward healthier states through precise, context-
dependent adjustments rather than simply suppressing pathology.

The first step requires breaking persistent pathological states that resist conventional treatments.
Just as natural manipulators induce controlled disruption to increase host flexibility, engineered
interventions must create defined windows of plasticity in target tissues. These transient windows
enable reorganisation of existing regulatory networks, allowing emergence of new stable states
that cannot be formed under ingrained maladaptive feedback loops. The aim of initial step is to
induce conditions that loosen rigid regulatory feedback loops, creating a window during which
cells and tissues become more receptive to subsequent guidance (Fig. 3). Moderate acute
inflammation can prompt re-evaluation of setpoints without causing extensive damage. This
approach mirrors controlled circuit-breaking observed during natural developmental transitions,
where temporary suspension of homeostatic constraints enables profound tissue remodelling.
Success depends on precise temporal and spatial control - disruption must be sufficient to enable
subsequent therapeutic modification while remaining contained within defined tissue zones.

Once the pathological state is destabilised, the next challenge is steering the tissue towards
desirable endpoints. The window of plasticity is brief, because once inflammation becomes
chronic, it establishes a new rigid pathological homeostatic range. Successful reprogramming
requires carefully timed signals that guide cells into the desired functional identity. Natural
systems provide templates of sequential reorganisation: trophoblast cells remodel maternal
vessels in a tightly regulated progression, parasites modulate host behaviour step by step and
cancers gradually shift their microenvironment into a self-sustaining pathological niche. Thus,
signals must be introduced in the proper order and intensity. This might be achieved by pairing
sensing modules that detect local conditions with inducible genetic circuits or timed-release
vehicles, thereby prompting tissues to adopt new phenotypes, regenerate structures or regain
immunological balance (Xie & Fussenegger, 2018; Hun Jin & Weiss, 2019; Dang et al., 2018).
Manipulating the extracellular matrix, cell-cell communication pathways and metabolic resource
flows consolidates these transitions, shifting the system away from disease and towards
functional restoration. This is not limited to molecular signals. Modification of the extracellular
matrix composition and tissue stiffness can shape cell fate, as well as electrical gradients or
metabolic signals. Carefully engineered agents may leverage cells' innate capacity to respond to
coordinated environmental changes.


[PAGE 29]
The final step of an engineered intervention is to establish new regulatory baselines that persist
after the initial triggers are withdrawn, enabling tissues to maintain improved structure or
function under their own feedback loops (Fig. 3). By employing epigenetic modulation, adjusting
long-range signalling or reconfiguring resource flows, it becomes possible to stabilise altered
tissue identities and immune profiles. Achieving this stability depends on controlling both the
local microenvironment and the broader systemic context. Strengthening a beneficial immune
niche or ensuring that vascular patterns match healthy metabolic demands avoids the reliance on
continuous external input. Over time, the host's own regulatory processes uphold the new steady
states.

Modifying tissue structure, tuning metabolism, altering immune relationships or modulating
neural inputs makes limited sense when pursued in isolation. In nature, successful manipulators
coordinate interventions across multiple levels of organisation, harnessing innate plasticity to re-
evaluate setpoints and establish new equilibria. These integrated tactics could guide new
therapies local inflammation could be induced to reset certain homeostatic parameters,
reprogram cell identity through precisely timed morphogen pulses and re-establish vascular or
neural patterns aligned with the intended outcome. As external signals are gradually withdrawn,
the system settles into a stable new identity. Instead of constant management, the ultimate goal
is a lasting internal reconfiguration that stands on its own.

Substantial research must concentrate on developing tools that enable interventions at each stage
of biological system hijacking. Synthetic biology provides a growing toolkit to engineer
responsive gene circuits that adapt to cellular states moving beyond uniform approaches.
Advances in materials science offer dynamic scaffolds that adapt as tissues evolve. Whilst
promising, these emerging fields require considerable scaling of efforts. It is essential to develop
technologies that allow controlled spatial and temporal interventions, along with robust sensors
to track cellular and tissue states in real time. Interventions must self-calibrate according to tissue

homeostasis via emerging technologies. These examples are illustrative potential strategies, rather than established clinical
approaches. Figure created with BioRender.

The final step of an engineered intervention is to establish new regulatory baselines that persist
after the initial triggers are withdrawn, enabling tissues to maintain improved structure or
function under their own feedback loops (Fig. 3). By employing epigenetic modulation, adjusting

Advances in materials science offer dynamic scaffolds that adapt as tissues evolve. Whilst
promising, these emerging fields require considerable scaling of efforts. It is essential to develop
technologies that allow controlled spatial and temporal interventions, along with robust sensors
to track cellular and tissue states in real time. Interventions must self-calibrate according to tissue
responses and/or changing conditions, adjusting signals and mechanical or biochemical
properties based on evolving tissue contexts. Engineered cells must adjust their secretome in
response to local cues. Furthermore, it is essential to develop tools that can edit chromatin states,
DNA methylation profiles and histone marks in targeted cells, enabling stable shifts in gene
expression without continuous intervention.

Identifying what to target and how to reprogram requires comprehensive data sets that capture
the complexity of biological organisation. It is necessary to collect detailed spatial and temporal
maps of gene expression, epigenetic profiles, electrical activity, proteomes, mechanical features
and cell-cell signalling patterns across healthy and diseased tissues. Single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics, advanced proteomics and metabolomics, and in vivo imaging will vital to
document baseline states and how these states shift under stress or experimental manipulation.
Machine learning and computational modelling can integrate these large data sets, identifying
key regulatory constraints, point potential pathways for intervention and understand how
alterations at one scale affect higher-level organisation. Developing predictive models that
simulate tissues responses to controlled perturbations enables the design of interventions that
achieve desired outcomes with minimal trial and error. These engineered interventions remain
largely theoretical; developing mechanistic models and quantitative predictions is essential to
harness these strategies and guide experimental validation.

[PAGE 30] V. Conclusions

(1) The hierarchical regulatory networks that maintain biological homeostasis contain intrinsic
vulnerabilities; these weaknesses make systems susceptible to both self-defecting and foreign
agents, which bypass established control mechanisms.

(2) Intruders exploit these vulnerabilities by hijacking conserved signalling pathways - through
molecular mimicry, targeted interference and reprogramming of feedback loops - to override host
defences and rewire host regulatory networks.

(3) The transient induction of plasticity is a critical step in hijacking; by perturbing homeostatic
setpoints, manipulators establish a state in the host that becomes self-reinforcing and
compromises normal function.

(4) Interactions among the immune, neural, endocrine and metabolic systems are central to both
the disruption of host regulation and the reprogramming that follows.

(5) By clarifying the mechanisms underlying biological manipulation, this framework provides
a blueprint for engineered interventions. Strategies that induce transient plasticity and rewire host
regulatory networks to reset homeostatic setpoints may reverse pathological states, restore
regenerative capacity and guide the development of integrated therapies that re-establish stable,
self-sustaining tissue function.

Fig. 1. Principles of hierarchical organisation in living systems operating uniformly across all scales.
Fig. 2. The six-step recipe for successful biological manipulation. First (A), the manipulator (marked 'M') breaches and anchors itself within the host environment, bypassing or disrupting physical barriers. It then discards or conceals its ‘M' identity (B), adopting host-like properties to evade immune surveillance. Once disguised, it shatters homeostatic controls (C), disabling the host's regulatory balance and inducing an inflamed, permissive state. Next, it seizes communication networks (D), rewiring or blocking signals to misdirect the host's collective defences. The manipulator then remodels tissue architecture (E), creating niches that favour its expansion and persistence. Finally (F), it consolidates long-term control by embedding itself within the host's regulatory fabric, ensuring that the altered state is maintained. Figure created with BioRender.
