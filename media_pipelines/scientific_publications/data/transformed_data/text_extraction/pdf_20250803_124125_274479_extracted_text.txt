Abstract
The slime mould *Physarum polycephalum* has been used in developing unconventional computing devices for which the slime mould played a role of a sensing, actuating, and computing device. These devices treated the slime mould rather as an active living substrate yet the slime mould is a self-consistent living creature which evolved for millions of years and occupied most part of the world. To “rehabilitate" the slime mould from the rank of a purely living electronics element to a “creature of thoughts” we are analyzing the cognitive potential of *P. polycephalum*. We base our theory of minimal cognition of the slime mould on a bottom-up approach, from the biological and biophysical nature of the slime mould and its regulatory systems using frameworks such as Lyon's biogenic cognition, Müller, di Primio-Lengeler's modifiable pathways, Bateson's “patterns that connect" framework, Maturana's autopoietic network, proto-consciousness and Morgan's Canon.


[PAGE 3] Introduction
Classic approaches to cognition were based on human beings, or sometimes, included some great apes or close mammals, leaving unattended a long list of living entities [1]. This biased anthropomorphic perspective had a second problem: it blocked pathways to an evolutionary and naturalistic study of cognition [2]. It is easy to find several studies on minimal examples of cognition among prokaryotes [3], with protists being a perfect example. Of them, ameboides (Myxomycetes) are the best example of the power of such cognitive studies, because they show us the connection bridge between unicellular (*Physarum*) to pluricellular (*Dictyostelium*) living systems. Thus, *Physarum polycephalum* shows to be an extremely intelligent system which offers unique ways for the understanding of the emergence of complex behaviours and cognitive strategies [4, 5, 6]. The mapping of such minimal cognitive elements in Slime mould makes possible the analysis of two fundamental ideas: first, to identify the computational nature of basic cognitive processes, which in our case offer a good example of a reliable Kolmogorov-Uspensky biomachine; this biocomputational approach offers a naturalistic way to explain the intricacies of informational processing from scratch to the supervenience of proto-consciousness. This process can be explained without relying on any anthropomorphic bias thanks to implementation of Morgan's Canon. As a consequence, slime mould offers a unique biological framework for the identification of the basic biocomputations that make possible cognition and pave the way for the emergence of consciousness (understood as a meta-level of informational processing). In the next section we describe in more detail the value of such selection for the study of cognition.

[PAGE 3] Minimal Cognition: the Bottom-up Approach to Cognition
After the long and intense analysis of human, primate and mammal cognition, the necessity of explaining their evolutionary and basic functional properties led to the interest for minimal forms of cognition. This minimal cognition interest was then focused into plants [7, 8] and the fundamental chemical mechanisms that rule their behaviour [9]. Fundamental aspects of biological systems were detected: they process, store and process information, a kind of computation [10, 11]. Other studies have also analyzed the cognitive skills of bacteria [12, 13, 14]. Despite some attempts at defining a minimal structure for the existence of cognition [15], we strongly disagree with the idea that emotional and conscious spheres are necessarily and uniquely dependent on neurodynamic processes [16]. The principles that allow, justify and sustain consciousness must rely at a lower level, and other mathematical approaches have provided simple informational mechanisms able to be performed by slime moulds as the basis of data integration and conscious experience. Despite some very interesting attempts at looking for the phylogenetic emergence of consciousness [17], most of the studies elude the analysis of fundamental aspects which could explain a naturalistic and scalable explanation of consciousness increase in complexity. Some general analysis about this new approach has been done by [18] and will be explained with more detail in next sections. In no way are we embracing panpsychist or panexperientalist approaches, as could be misleadingly inferred. At the same time we wish not to dilute our research into unending philosophical debates. Slime moulds know and gather knowledge via their specific proto-consciousness.

Taking into account these elements we wish to descend even more into the tree of life and select slime mould as a very minimal cognitive system [19]. Despite the very simple cognitive architecture, slime mould are able to perform an incredible list of cognitive tasks as well as to be creative [20], considering this skill as an emergent property of their genomic structure, as it works for other living systems [21]. As noted by [22], the slime mould shows outstanding abilities to adapt its protoplasmic network to varying environmental conditions in which it can solve tasks of computational geometry, image processing, logic and arithmetic if and only if data are represented by binary configurations of attractants and repellents. We speculate that in slime mould cognition is embedded with computation in morphological patterns of protoplasmic networks updated locally similarly to a computational process travelling in disordered dynamically changing graphs, or storage structures, of Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines [23, 24, 25, 26].

[PAGE 5] Defining the Nature of Slime Mould
The slime moulds are a polyphyletic group of protistic organisms existing in three major categories: ‘true', acellular or plasmodial slime moulds of class Myxogastria, cellular or pseudoplasmodial slime moulds of class Dictyosteliida and the unicellular microscopic slime moulds of class Protosteliales [27]. Of the former two varieties, the first is a multinucleate single cell and the second is a multicellular complex. Therefore, all slime moulds could be tested for minimal cognition and proto-consciousness.

The basic regulatory functions (as metabolic ones) can explain the emergence of cognitive mechanisms [28], and therefore both homeostatic and homeodynamic perspectives can allow the existence of a minimal cognition. But in no case can proto-consciousness only be considered as the summation of different minimal cognitions, instead of the result of the emergence of entangled multi-taxis or multi-tropisms functioning in coherence or decoherence.

Acellular slime mould *P. polycephalum* has a sophisticated life cycle [29], which includes fruit bodies, spores, single-cell myxamoebae and the plasmodium, a multinucleated syncytium [30]. The plasmodium is a coenocyte: nuclear divisions occur without cytokinesis. The plasmodium is a large cell. It grows up to tens of centimetres when conditions are good. The plasmodium consumes microscopic particles, bacteria and flakes of oats. During its foraging behaviour the plasmodium spans scattered sources of nutrients with a network of protoplasmic tubes. The plasmodium optimises its protoplasmic network to cover all sources of nutrients, stay away from repellents and minimise transportation of metabolites inside its body. The plasmodium's ability to optimise its shape [31] attracted attention of biologists, then computer scientists [32] and engineers. Thus the field of slime mould computing was born.

So far, the plasmodium is the only stage of *P. polycephalum*'s life cycle useful for computation. Therefore further we will use word ‘Physarum’ when referring to the plasmodium. Most computing and sensing devices made of Physarum explore one or more key features of Physarum's physiology and behaviour:

• the slime mould senses gradients of chemoattractants and repellents [33, 34, 35]; it responds to chemical or physical stimulation by changing patterns of electrical potential oscillations [36, 37] and protoplasmic tubes contractions [38, 39];

[PAGE 6]
• it optimises its body to maximise its protoplasm streaming [40]; and,
• it is made of hundreds, if not thousands, of biochemical oscillators [41, 42] with varied modes of coupling [43].

Slime mould can be seen, if we think at a very simplified level, as a reaction-diffusion excitable system encapsulated in an elastic growing membrane [44]. The behaviour of Physarum is governed by an ensemble of thousands of biochemical oscillators, which set local clocks and control peristaltic activity and growth via propagation of actin polymerisation waves and calcium waves. Coupling between distant parts of Physarum via waves of electrical potential is manifested in oscillations of the electrical potential.

[PAGE 6] What Does a Slime Mould Know?
Living systems process information in order to react to the environment and to be able to survive or to transmit their own informational structure [45]. We can define this process as “knowledge”, because the living system does not produce automated responses, like a thermostat can do, but it implies certain evaluation.

Physarum lives in the world of gradients, concentrations of attractants and repellents, and consequently its behavioural responses are a direct consequence of their interaction with these gradients. For example: while propagating on a substrate the slime mould avoids domains with concentrations of repellents that exceed a threshold, see e.g. [46].

[PAGE 6] Modifiable stimulus-response pathways from an autopoietic perspective [base of all behaviours]
We must admit that one of the key roles for the development of a living system is its operational autonomy according to the organism's own internal program [47, 48].

This determines the basic actions with which the system reacts to stimuli from the environment – stimuli acting on the system through certain internal environment structurally coupled receptors. In fact, Maturana and Varela [49] determined their autopoietic theory considering that the problem of autonomy had to be reduced to its minimal form, in the characterization of the basic living unit.

[PAGE 7]
An autonomous system that is self-maintained (as it is autopoietic) generates both development paths and coherent organization, allowing us to describe it as an agent. But the relationship between agency and cognition, within the framework of autonomy, is still precarious.  An autonomous system being self-maintained and offering a homeodynamic balance is not sufficient reason for the emergence of a discriminatory semiosis and therefore a minimum cognitive principle.

In short, the basic self-maintenance networks of metabolism, capable of certain forms of adaptive responses, do not show those skills necessary for the emergence of minimal cognition [50]. A more complex organization, which gathers mechanisms that go beyond this basic metabolism, is necessary. That is, the mechanisms of internal compensation of interactions with the immediate environment are responsible for the emergence of a biosemiotic discrimination of second level macromolecules, allowing both the reception and distinguishing between what is noise and what is significant for the autonomous agential system.

We also take into account the generation of autopoietic subsystems when explaining the minimum domains of perceptual activity in a structurally stable autopoietic organization. These establish a new criterion of interdependent autonomy within a hierarchy in the organization of living things. Cellular components are established as autopoietic interdependent subsystems in a hierarchical level lower than the cell. Subsystems comprising a minimum subvenient enactivity, both morphologically and physiologically, exert a specific regulatory function. We can say, in the words of Leonardo Bich and Alvaro Moreno [28, 16], that these are specific regulatory subsystems.

Regulation is understood as the capacity of living beings to internally compensate for disturbances [16]. Exogenous environmental phenomena or disturbances are managed by the agential systems that confer significance, and therefore an intrinsic biosemantics, to dynamic patterns of transduced self-regulation. In the words of Piaget, it is assimilation and accommodation [51] to the operational closure of the agent to overcome the binomial “stimulus – response". That is, the interaction between an organism and the environment through ontogenetic adaptation is considered an assimilation of external influences; it involves an internal self-regulation, or accommodation, and thus a restructuring of the system. This provides a dynamic and cyclical view of self-regulation: endogenous action → interaction with Umwelt → self-regulatory disturbance compensation → internal re-balancing, etc. [52].

[PAGE 8]
To achieve effective regulation, an interdependent control autopoietic subsystem is necessary. This subsystem must be sufficiently independent of the dynamics of the processes controlled, and can be changed without interrupting these processes; but also it must be able to be linked to parts of the control mechanism of the system, a regulated subsystem, in order to be able to modulate its operations [28]. More specifically, the appearance of a control subsystem implies that the organism itself generates a set of decoupled processes from the dynamics of their constitutive system. The dynamic decoupling between the regulator and the regulated constituent subsystems means that both, although they are correlated through the system, are integrated, working at different intrinsic rhythms. That is, the regulation components are produced and maintained by the activity of the constituent subsystems regulated, and said activity, in turn, is modulated by the regulator.

As occurs in the TCST system of *Escherichia coli* bacteria [53], this happens when the function of the regulation subsystem is neither specified nor directly determined by the metabolic activity of constituent subsystems regulated: that is, it is “stoichiometrically free” [54], so there is no biochemical balance between them. More specifically, the fundamental idea of this form of decoupling is that activation and operation of the control subsystem is not directly dependent on its concentration (or concentration variation), i.e., of its production by the constituent subsystems regulated, even though these subsystems ensure their presence in the system. In contrast, activation of the control subsystem is caused by environmental disturbances, and operations depend on their internal organization and structure of its functional components. So the regulator subsystem can work operationally differently from the constituent subsystems regulated, and can, in principle, act as a regulator controller of regulated constituent subsystems [28].

[PAGE 8] Recognition in regulators subsystems
In this organizational architecture, the functional role of a regulator subsystem is to modulate the basic constituent network, switching between different metabolic systems available in the system in relation to changes in environmental conditions. It does so in such a way that new metabolic/constituent regimes engendered by regulatory switches must be able to cope with the new environmental conditions, expanding the range of disturbances or stimuli to which the system can respond quickly and efficiently, and enrich the field of dynamic functional behaviours available.

[PAGE 9]
The crucial thing is that the organism endowed with regulatory systems reacts in a new way, doing things according to what it recognizes and distinguishes in its interactions with the “Umwelt" of the autopoietic regulator subsystem. In fact, "recognition" is a complex process, since the specific characteristics of the interactions with the Umwelt that are responsible for triggering the subsystem regulations cannot directly drive the system response, as in the case of responses from the basic network. In fact, a disruption activates a certain regulation subsystem, which in turn modulates the basic constituent network so as to meet the specific environmental characteristic that triggered the regulatory response.

A couple of examples applicable to myxomycete *P. polycephalum* would be:
• that the organism is powered by a new source of food richer in nutrients that allows it to gain more energy, even if it decides to choose the path with the worst environmental conditions, which would lead to a poor nutrient food source [55].
• that it transforms their morphology — from plasmodium to sclerotium — to preserve itself in a hostile environment lacking food, minimizing its respiration [56] and maximizing its longevity [57, 58, 59].

In other words, the fact of recognition is a consequence of the specific nature of the disturbance and the internal regulatory organization of the system.

[PAGE 9] Recognition and equivalence classes
In such a scenario, an environmental disturbance becomes a specific and recognizable interaction due to the nature of the relationship with the controller subsystem. The regulator subsystem is responsive to the disturbance, in the sense that it endogenously establishes equivalence classes in their environment with respect to these specific changes, according to how variations activate the controller subsystem to trigger regulatory action. These equivalence classes do not consist of externally associations between the disturbances and the results of the changes brought about in the system as a whole, as in the previous case. Rather, they are the results of the evaluation (activation of the control subsystem and further regulatory action on the constituent subsystems regulated) operated by their regulation subsystem that achieve endogenous and functional significance for the system.

[PAGE 9] Therefore, beyond the debate about whether cognition is coextensive with life, it is clear that regulation becomes a necessary condition for the appearance of cognition, considering as an essential aspect of cognition that the knower should be capable of transforming an external influence into an adaptive integration or, in cognitive terms, into a meaningful interpretation [16]. And this requirement essential for cognition is carried out only by regulation rather than by basic biological self-production and self-maintenance (i.e., minimal autopoietic systems), as some of the defenders of the tautology of life and cognition have argued.

[PAGE 10] Significant Regulation
A system with normativity capacity is able to do things according to what it distinguishes (what the regulation subsystem is sensitive to). Consequently, interactions with the environment become more than a source of confusing noise, but become a world generated endogenously (naturalized) of meanings, an Umwelt [60, 61]: interactions functionally become "significant" for the system itself, without being so to an outside observer. Here the term “meaning” is used as a synonym for “functional for the system” (see [15]). More specifically, a source of disturbance makes sense when it can be distinguished by the regulatory subsystem and this distinction has an operational effect on the system. Through the action of the regulatory system, the subsystem modulates its own activity (in the constituent subsystems regulated) on the basis of this distinction, thus contributing to their own self-maintenance.

[PAGE 10] Electrical activity
Another example of a normative regulatory system can be seen in the regulation of Ca²⁺ for activation or inhibition of myosin, allowing oscillations of current flow for plasmodium displacement. Here Ca²⁺ acts as an inhibitor of the oscillations of the actin-myosin, but in the opposite direction of the existing inhibitory activity in the process of contraction of animal muscle cells. The absence of Ca²⁺ in neuromuscular processes inhibits contracture activity while in plasmodia; inhibition increased by Ca²⁺ [62] arises. Ca²⁺ is a powerful oscillator in the presence of cAMP in the environment of the plasmodium [63]. More broadly, the extensive utilization of bioelectric phenomena by Physarum [64, 65, 66, 37] dovetails with the broader use of ionic signaling in morphological computation throughout metazoans. Indeed, ion channel and neurotransmitter hardware, which underlie the software of cognition in animal brains, are evolutionarily ancient and pre-date multicellularity [67, 68, 69, 70]. For a review of cognitive approaches to decision-making and memory in non-neural metazoan cells and tissues in the context of embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression see [71, 72, 73]. The reading of bioelectric states of Physarum during learning and problem-solving, to achieve a kind of "neural" decoding, is an on-going effort at the frontier of this field.

[PAGE 11] Regulatory subsystems independent of metabolic processes
In the same way that the phenomenon of chemotaxis is seen in the bacteria *E. coli*, myxomycetes also offer specific chemotaxis, both in the multicellular pseudoplasmodium *Dictyostelium discoideum* [74, 75, 76] and the acellular plasmodium *P. polycephalum* [77, 78, 34]. But taking the phenomenon of chemotaxis as a condition for a cognitive process requires, as [16] explains, that part of the regulatory subsystems be independent of metabolic processes. This case is a complex form of driven stability taxis, achieved through the coupling of two subsystems and indirect feedback through the environment. The movement here is autonomous and depends on the internal differentiation of the organization and activity inherent in the self-maintenance of the cell. Additionally, this behaviour is functional in the sense that it contributes to the maintenance of conditions of existence of metabolism and consequently of the entire system. However, in this example, although the system is capable of complex viable behaviours, the system responds as a network without distinguishing the specifics of their interaction with the environment, evaluating them and modulating action accordingly. In this case, the environment is only a noise source that disturbs the metabolism, and the behavioural response is filtered through the latter. This chemotactic mechanism involves at least three molecular complexes:
• a receiver subsystem, which is activated by environmental effectors (chemoattractants and chemorepellents);
• a conductive tip in the case of pseudopod plasmodia and pseudoplasmodia; and
• a group of molecules and macromolecular filaments which act as a bridge between the two. Usually, the latter are activated molecules

[PAGE 12] through non-covalent post-transducer modifications, such as phosphorylation cascades.
The distinguishing feature of this complex case of chemotactic behaviour is that the system, thanks to the action of a control subsystem, is able to modulate their behaviour based on specific interactions with the environment, which acquires a specific operational meaning for the system, so that the latter is able to change their behaviour accordingly. This is made possible by the fact that the regulation subsystem is decoupled from the others. This means that the regulatory subsystem in the case of plasmodia *P. polycephalum* would be a reaction-diffusion pattern [79] through the filaments and myosin microtubules. It is the stimulus that comes from attractants or repellents (external) that requires the material to adapt to their spatial behaviour. The specific mechanism used is the diffusion of attractants or repellents in the environment. The presence of these stimuli in the periphery of the material provides the impetus for morphological adaptation [80]. This decoupling introduces a new degree of freedom in the system, one or more new variables in the controller subsystem which does not depend directly on the constitutive regime and therefore may be sensitive to something different than the internal state of the system: in this case, a characteristic of the environment. This characteristic takes on an important role for the entire system, and the decoupling subsystem achieves a functional role when the effect of its regulatory action, caused by the disturbance, occurs and contributes to system maintenance. From this relatively elementary chemotactic mechanism, a variety of more complex tactical behaviours can be implemented [28, 16]. What is common to them is that they cannot be treated in terms of input-output, as if the behaviour of the system was caused by the disturbance. On the contrary, they can be characterized in terms of endogenous generation of adaptive response by focusing on the internal organisation of the system and, above all, regulatory subsystems. So we conclude that chemotaxis of myxomycetes, such as bacterial chemotaxis, represents a clear comparative example of how certain fundamental capabilities for the origin of cognition may arise in minimal living systems, and how this is possible only through the action of regulatory mechanisms. Only in the presence of regulation do specific disturbances acquire a meaning for the system. This is a biosemiotic foundation of the basics of cognitive minimum principles, with emerging regulatory system factors acquiring those minimum principles offered in cognitive biology [81, 82, 49, 83, 84, 85].

[PAGE 13] Minimal Cognitive Principles in Myxomycetes. Cognitive biology as framework
From the Darwinian theory of species, each organism is evolving from a common root. This is very important as the foundation of a common root of the minimal cognitive principles that underpin higher emergent developments. For this reason, three additional elements are required in cognitive biology:
• the study of cognition in a species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, for the study of the cognitive capacities of another species [86];
• to proceed with more complex cognitive systems, it is useful to start from the simplest organisms [87]; and
• for a better understanding of the nature of cognition, the greater the number and variety of species studied in this sense [88].

While cognitive science strives to explain human thought and the conscious mind, the work of cognitive biology focuses on the most fundamental process of cognition of any organism [89]. Cognitive biology is, therefore, a new approach to biological paradigms about cognition that needs a coherent contextualisation, both to experimental data and to a semantic development of biology. Ladislav Kovac of the Department of Biochemistry and Genetics of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the Comenius University in Bratislava states in [90] that:
"Cognitive biology is more a reinterpretation of existing data than a research program that offers new experimental approaches to old problems.”
and adds:
“Cognitive biology aims at a synthesis of data from various scientific disciplines within a single framework of conceiving life as the epistemic unfolding of the universe (the epistemic principle). According to evolutionary epistemology, it considers biological evolution as a progressive process of accumulation of knowledge.
Knowledge manifests itself in the constructions of organisms, and the structural complexity of the constructions that carry the incorporated knowledge corresponds to its epistemological complexity. In contrast to evolutionary epistemology, cognitive biology is based on the assumption that the molecular level is fundamental to cognition and adheres to a principle of minimum complexity, which states that the most efficient way to study any trait of life is by studying it at the simplest level in which it occurs."

For this reason, the interest in a new reformulation of the concept of cognitive process and intelligence requires a deeper understanding of the behaviour of living systems, where cognition does not depend on the existence of a nervous system that channels it, but on functional circuits which allow the minimal perception of the surrounding environment and its biosemiotic processing *in vivo* [91].

[PAGE 14] Minimal Cognition Principles Illustrated by Tables of Conceptual Relationships

[PAGE 14] Pamela Lyon's Table
Pamela Christine Lyon of the University of Adelaide in Australia argues that cognition is a natural biological phenomenon of maximum access, like other natural biological phenomena: by studying simple model systems (such as bacteria, myxomycete) one can understand the bases and then expand to more complex examples (from bees and ants to hominids). Lyon develops a biocognition (as van Dujin [92] says) from a biogenic framework, whose approach tries to anchor the concept of cognition itself in biology. In this approach, cognition is primarily a form of biological adaptation that confers certain selective advantages specific to organisms by allowing them to cope with environmental complexity. Pamela Lyon [84] synthesizes in ten biogenic principles the development that Kovac [90] made based on the principles of cognitive biology. This synthesis illustrates the depth of the bases with which they have been established in the school of cognitive biology of Adelaide and which are listed as follows:
1. Continuity: Complex cognitive abilities have evolved from the simplest forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of significant descent. (Do not rule out the appearance of new capabilities with greater complexity).
2. Control: Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physical-chemical processes that constitute an organism.
3. Interaction: Cognition facilitates the establishment of reciprocal relations of causality with the characteristics of the environment, giving rise to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential for the continuous persistence of the organism, well-being or reproduction.
4. Normativity: Cognition refers to the (more or less) continuous assessment of the needs of the system relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.
5. Memory: Cognition requires the ability to retain information for a period of time greater than zero.
6. Selectivity: Because an organism is able to interact profitably with some, but not all, properties of the environment, cognition involves the differentiation of some states from other states of affairs.
7. Valence: In relation to the needs of the body and/or experience, different environmental properties will be invested with different degrees of strength or importance, both positive and negative.
8. Anticipation: Cognition is intrinsically future oriented (what happens next?) and therefore predictive.
9. Reduction of randomness: Cognition is an important mechanism by which biological systems reduce and modulate the influence of random perturbations on their functioning and, therefore, are resistant to disturbances.
10. Interdependence: The biochemical pathways that innervate cognition are intimately linked to those of other biological functions, making delimitation difficult and largely a function of explanatory objectives. (The map is not the territory).

To find the minimum processes of cognition in cognitive biology we must take into account the production and processing of communication signals for the behaviour of the group and types of interconnection between individual units (cells).

Bernd S. Müller and Franco di Primio, both of the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems of the German National Research Center for Information Technology, and Joseph W.

[PAGE 21] Gregory Bateson's Table
Gregory Bateson's contribution to cognitive biology is that he stated that matter and energy are impregnated with circular processes of information of differences, creating "patterns that connect”. His project was to explain the mind in terms of complexity and cybernetic organisation. The six criteria that integrate the cognitive processes, or as Bateson calls them, mental processes, are:
1. A mind is a set of interacting parts or components. It is an autopoietic concept that is a network of interacting components.
2. The interaction of the parts of the mind is triggered by difference, and difference is a non-substantial phenomenon that is found neither in space nor time; difference is related to neguentropy and entropy rather than to energy.
3. The mental process requires collateral energy. In this criterion Bateson highlights the distinction between the ways in which living organisms and non-living systems interact with their environments. What Bateson exposes is that to describe the energy of life and to describe that of the forces and interactions of the non-living there should be a differentiated syntax.
4. The mental process requires circular (or more complex) processes of determination. Like Uexküll's *Funktionkreises*, Bertalanffy's biofeedback and Maturana and Varela's Autopoiesis.
5. In the mental process, the effects of difference must be seen as transformations (i.e., coded versions) of events that have preceded them.
6. The description and classification of these processes of transformation reveal a hierarchy of logical prototypes immanent in phenomena.

These criteria by Gregory Bateson on cognitive processes have been linked to the cognitive processes of Humberto Maturana.
