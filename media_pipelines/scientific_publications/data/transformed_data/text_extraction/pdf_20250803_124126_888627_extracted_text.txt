[PAGE 1] SUMMARY

Serotonin (5-HT) is a neuromodulator involved in regulating mood, appetite, memory, learning, pain, and establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry in embryonic development. To explore the role of 5-HT in physiology, we have created two forms of "caged" 5-HT, BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT. When exposed to 365 or 740 nm light, BHQ-O-5HT releases 5-HT through one- or two-photon excitation, respectively. BHQ-O-5HT mediated changes in neural activity in cultured mouse primary sensory neurons and the trigeminal ganglion and optic tectum of intact zebrafish larvae in the form of high-amplitude spiking in response to light. In *Xenopus laevis* embryos, light-activated 5-HT increased the occurrence of LR patterning defects. Maximal rates of LR defects were observed when 5-HT was released at stage 5 compared with stage 8. These experiments show the potential for BHQ-caged serotonins in studying 5-HT-regulated physiological processes.


[PAGE 1] INTRODUCTION

Serotonin (5-hydroxytyptamine or 5-HT) is an ancient biogenic amine found in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including animals, plants, fungi, and pathogenic amoebae (Barnes and Sharp, 1999; Feldberg and Toh, 1953; Hoyer et al., 1994; Jackson and Yakel, 1995; McGowan et al., 1983; Roshchina, 2001). In vertebrates, 5-HT is a neurotransmitter within both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and it also acts as a hormone in diverse tissues (Barnes and Sharp, 1999). In the brain, neurons in the raphe nuclei region produce 5-HT (Barnes and Sharp, 1999; Frazer and Hensler, 1999). These neurons project into the cortex and hippocampus and influence an enormous network of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (Frazer and Hensler, 1999) involved in regulating mood, appetite, memory, learning, and other cognitive functions (Barnes and Sharp, 1999; Daubert and Condron, 2010; Feldberg and Toh, 1953; Kang et al., 2009; McGowan et al., 1983; Rapport et al., 1948). Serotonin in the CNS and periphery plays a complex role in mediating pain, both by acting as an algesic by exciting the peripheral terminations of primary afferent neurons, and in pain suppression via descending pathways (Bardin, 2011; Basbaum and Fields, 1978). Interestingly, 5-HT also is involved in embryonic development and the establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry (Levin et al., 2006; Vandenberg and Levin, 2010). This diversity of function implicates 5-HT in several physiological and pathological processes.

In mammals and other vertebrates, 5-HT function is mediated by a large number of different receptors. In mammals, there are 14 structurally and pharmacologically distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes that are grouped into seven major families of 5-HT receptors, designated 5-HT1-7 (Hoyer et al., 1994). One of these families, the 5-HT3 receptors, comprises ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission (Barnes and Sharp, 1999) through a transient inward current that rapidly depolarizes the cell. The remaining six receptor families are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and mediate a wide range of physiological and pharmacological responses (Barnes and Sharp, 1999). Several classes of antidepressant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and antimigraine drugs target these 5-HT signaling systems (Barnes and Sharp, 1999).

To explore the role of 5-HT in a variety of physiological contexts, a light-activated form of it would be useful. This can be achieved by covalently connecting a photoremovable protecting group (PPG) to 5-HT, thereby blocking or "caging" its action (Ellis-Davies, 2007; Klán et al., 2013; Kramer and Chambers, 2011; Lee et al., 2009; Mayer and Heckel, 2006; Specht et al., 2009; Young and Deiters, 2007). Exposure to light releases or "uncages" 5-HT in its active form. Ideally, the caged 5-HT would be highly sensitive to light at wavelengths not detrimental to biological systems; release 5-HT rapidly; and in quantitative yield upon light exposure, exhibit no off-target effects, and be completely stable under physiological conditions in the dark. In addition, sensitivity to 5-HT release through two-photon excitation (2PE) is desirable for localization of release to subcellular levels (Bort et al., 2013; Dore, 2005; Dore and Wilson, 2011; Warther et al., 2010). Four caged 5-HTs are known in the literature: 2-((2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-2-(2-nitrophenyl)acetic acid (N-CNB-5HT), 2-((3-(2-aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl)oxy)-2-(2-nitrophenyl)acetic acid (O-CNB-5HT), 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl (2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl) carbamate (NPEC-N-5HT) (Boahen and MacDonald, 2005; Breitinger et al., 2000), and [Ru(bpy)2(5HT)2]2+ (Zayat et al., 2006). Hess and coworkers synthesized N-CNB-5HT and O-CNB-5HT to study the kinetics of the 5-HT3 ligand-gated ion channel (Breitinger et al., 2000). The rate constant for release of 5-HT from N-CNB-5HT was too slow for that compound to be useful in the study, but O-CNB-5HT had sufficiently rapid release kinetics, albeit low photolysis Qu and molar absorptivity. The preparation and photolysis of 2-(5-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethoxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethanamine (NPE-O-5HT) (Boahen and MacDonald, 2005) and [Ru(bpy)2(5HT)2]2+ (Zayat et al., 2006) were reported by MacDonald and Etchenique, respectively, and Tocris Bioscience sells NPEC-N-5HT commercially (catalog no. 3991), but the use of these compounds in a study of 5-HT physiology has not yet been reported. We report the preparation of two (8-bromo-7-hydroxyquinolin-2-yl)methyl (BHQ)-protected 5-HT compounds 2-(((3-(2-aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl)oxy)methyl)-8-bromoquinolin-7-ol (BHQ-O-5HT) and (8-bromo-7-hydroxyquinolin-2-yl)methyl (2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl) carbamate (BHQ-N-5HT) (Figure 1) and their suitability for spatially and temporally controlling the release of 5-HT through one-photon excitation (1PE) and 2PE within a biological system. We found that BHQ-O-5HT depolarized sensory neurons when photolyzed in culture and in larval zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) comparable to that observed by 5-HT by itself. Light-induced release of 5-HT from BHQ-O-5HT in stage 5 *Xenopus laevis* embryos significantly increases the rate of LR patterning defects in the frog. Activation of 5-HT at later stages had a less significant effect.


[PAGE 2] RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We chose 8-bromo-7-hydroxyquinoline (BHQ) as the caging group for 5-HT because it has good sensitivity to 1PE-mediated photolysis at biologically compatible wavelengths (>350 nm) (Fedoryak and Dore, 2002; Zhu et al., 2006) and rapid release kinetics (Ma et al., 2012). High sensitivity to light is important for working in thick or pigmented biological tissues, such as whole larval zebrafish or *X. laevis* embryos. Rapid release kinetics is critical for studying fast signaling events initiated by neurotransmitters and for taking advantage of BHQ's sensitivity to 2PE (Fedoryak and Dore, 2002; Zhu et al., 2006), a sensitivity that is better than that of many groups currently used in biological studies, yet not as sensitive as others (Dore, 2005; Dore and Wilson, 2011; Klán et al., 2013; Warther et al., 2010). To take advantage of the tight spatial release that 2PE affords, the release kinetics must be faster than diffusion out of the excitation volume. BHQ's moderate sensitivity to 2PE and rapid release kinetics could be advantageous for future biological studies.

Typically, phenols and alcohols require a carbonate linker for efficient release from the caging group after photoexcitation, but the initially released carbonate must first decarboxylate to yield the free phenol or alcohol. This slow step of the release process (τ = 240–270 μs for phenols) is not optimal (Zhao et al., 2006). It would be better to release phenol directly. To test this, we synthesized 8-bromo-2-(phenoxymethyl)quinolin-7-ol (BHQ-OPh) from (8-bromo-7-(methoxymethoxy)quinolin-2-yl)methanol (MOM-BHQ-OH) (Figure 2A). MOM-BHQ-OH, prepared from 8-bromo-7-hydroxyquinaldine as described previously (Ma et al., 2012), was converted to the corresponding mesylate that was subsequently displaced by phenol in good yield to provide the desired phenyl ether. Removal of the methoxymethyl ether (MOM) protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in methanol afforded BHQ-OPh. BHQ-OPh was reasonably stable under simulated physiological conditions consisting of 100 mM potassium 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonate (KMOPS) buffer at pH 7.2, with a time constant for hydrolysis in the dark (τdark) = 95 hr. BHQ-OPh photolyzes with a quantum efficiency (Φu) = 0.19 at 365 nm and a 2PE photolysis uncaging action cross-section (δu) = 0.56 GM [GM = 10−50 (cm2 s)/photon] at 740 nm in KMOPS buffer (Figure 2A). Figure S1 (available online) shows the time course of photolysis of BHQ-OPh by 1PE and 2PE. These results demonstrated that phenols were sufficiently good leaving groups for light-mediated release from BHQ and that protection and release of the phenol on 5-HT (and other neuromodulators) from BHQ were feasible.

We prepared two versions of the photoactivatable 5-HT: BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT from MOM-BHQ-OH and an appropriately protected 5-HT (Figures 2B and 2C). These compounds are distinguished by the type of linkage between the PPG and 5-HT. The O-version has a phenolic ether linkage, whereas the N-version uses a carbamate linker. The latter would place limitations on the use of BHQ-N-5HT that are discussed below. To synthesize BHQ-O-5HT, MOM-BHQ-OH was converted to the corresponding mesylate and displaced by the Boc-protected serotonin *tert*-butyl (2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)carbamate (N-Boc-5HT) that was prepared as described previously (Breitinger et al., 2000), to generate the doubly protected compound *tert*-butyl (2-(5-((8-bromo-7-(methoxymethoxy)quinolin-2-yl)methoxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)carbamate [MOM-BHQ-O-5HT(N-Boc)]. Global deprotection with TFA in dichloromethane provided BHQ-O-5HT (Figure 2B).

BHQ-N-5HT was prepared by activating the primary alcohol with carbonyldiimidazole and then treating the resulting carbamate (MOM-BHQ-carbonylimidazole) with triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)-protected serotonin 2-(5-((triisopropylsilyl)oxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethanamine [5HT(O-TIPS)] that was prepared as described previously (Ho et al., 2003). Removal of first the TIPS protecting group with tetra-*n*-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) was followed by the MOM deprotection in acidic methanol to provide BHQ-N-5HT (Figure 2C).

Selected photophysical and photochemical properties of the two forms of caged 5-HT were examined (Table 1) and compared with previously reported caged 5-HTs (Boahen and MacDonald, 2005; Breitinger et al., 2000; Zayat et al., 2006). In contrast to the CNB- and NPE-protected 5-HTs, the BHQ-protected 5-HTs have absorbance maxima (λmax) above 350 nm and larger molar absorptivities (ε), but not as high as [Ru(bpy)2(5HT)2]2+ that is more absorbent in the visible region (Table 1). BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT were each photolyzed under simulated physiological conditions (KMOPS buffer [pH 7.2]) with 370 nm light from a mercury lamp (1PE) and 740 nm light from a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) (Figure 3). The time course of the reaction was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), measuring the disappearance of the caged compound and appearance of 5-HT (Figure 4). From these data, the 1-photon quantum efficiencies of photolysis (Φu) and the 2PE photolysis action cross-sections (δu) were calculated using previously described methods (Davis et al., 2009; Fedoryak and Dore, 2002; Furuta et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2006). Compared with the CNB- and NPE-protected 5-HTs and [Ru(bpy)2(5HT)2]2+, both BHQ-caged 5-HTs demonstrated superior Φu and sensitivity to light (Φu × ε) at biologically compatible wavelengths. The sensitivity of the NPE-protected 5-HTs was not explicitly reported (Boahen and MacDonald, 2005), but the sensitivity of a related compound, NPE-protected phenylephrine, is 682 at 272 nm (Walker et al., 1993), a shorter wavelength not well suited for biological experiments. The absorbance spectrum of NPE-caged ATP drops precipitously as the wavelength increases (Kaplan et al., 1978), indicating that NPE-protected 5-HTs also have low sensitivity at λ > 300 nm. BHQ-O-5HT was found to be the most sensitive of all seven caged 5-HTs at 368 nm. Both BHQ-protected 5-HTs were stable in the dark in buffered aqueous media. The δu values were not reported for the CNB-, NPE-, and Ru(bpy)2-protected 5-HTs, but the CNB and NPE groups are not considered sensitive to 2PE (δu ≤ 0.04 GM) (Dore, 2005; Dore and Wilson, 2011; Kiskin et al., 2002; Warther et al., 2010), and other conjugates of Ru(bpy)2 are only slightly more sensitive (δu = 0.01–0.14 GM) (Nikolenko et al., 2005; Salierno et al., 2010). The δu values of BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT were at least an order of magnitude larger than CNB- and NPE-protected 5-HT at 740 nm and sufficiently sensitive for use in biological systems. The time course for 2PE is in minutes because the excitation volume is smaller than the sample size, and more time is required for a sufficient amount of starting material to be photolyzed to detectable levels.

BHQ-N-5HT might be less useful in applications using 2PE or activating the ionotropic 5-HT receptors, because release of 5-HT from BHQ-N-5HT upon light exposure is slow. Initially formed carbamic acid intermediates typically decompose to CO2 and the amine on a 6–7 ms timescale (Papageorgiou and Corrie, 1997), a timescale that is slower than the diffusional escape time from the focal volume of 2PE excitation (estimated at 113–900 μs; Kiskin and Ogden, 2002) and the opening of ionotropic 5-HT-gated ion channels (5-HT3 receptors open on the order of 1–2 ms timescales and remain open for up to 10 ms; Jackson and Yakel, 1995). Time-resolved studies on BHQ-caged acetate (Ma et al., 2012) suggest that BHQ-O-5HT releases 5-HT on nanosecond timescales—orders of magnitude shorter than diffusional timescales.

To test the biological effects of BHQ-O-5HT on neural activity, extracellular recordings were obtained from dissociated sensory neurons prepared from mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the trigeminal ganglion or optic tectum in intact zebrafish larva during exposure to 5-HT, BHQ-O-5HT, or 8-bromo-2-(hydroxymethyl)quinolin-7-ol (BHQ-OH). Previous studies have shown that 5-HT elicits depolarizing responses in small-diameter trigeminal ganglion neurons in mammals and type A and C primary afferent neurons in the DRGs of mammals and frogs (Holz and Anderson, 1984; Holz et al., 1985; Todorović and Anderson, 1990; Tsutsui et al., 2008). 5-HT is also known to increase a hyperpolarization-activated cation current in type Aα and Aβ DRG neurons (Cardenas et al., 1999; Harper and Lawson, 1985a, 1985b; Scroggs et al., 1994; Villière and McLachlan, 1996). Figure 5 depicts the results for DRG neurons. For these experiments, recordings were obtained from DRG neurons with soma 19 ± 2 μm in diameter (Figure 5A) that are largely nociceptive afferent (C and Aδ) neurons, but they can include Aα/Aβ neurons (Harper and Lawson, 1985a, 1985b; Lawson and Waddell, 1991). Therefore, neurons were first tested for a response to 100 μM 5-HT, and then the same neurons were exposed to 500 μM BHQ-O-5HT or BHQ-OH (Figure 3), a control to test for the effects of the caging group. All compounds were administered by pressure ejection of 1 nl of solution from a micropipette, the tip of which was located 90–110 μm from the neuron cell body to minimize potential artifacts associated with the pressure ejection. Cells were exposed to a 1 ms pulse of 365 nm light 10 s after application of the compound. In all cases, pressure ejection of BHQ-O-5HT induced small changes in baseline activity DRG neurons that were likely due to small amounts of uncaged 5-HT in the solution; however, activity comparable to uncaged 5-HT was observed only after exposure to a 1 ms pulse of 365 nm light (compare Figure 5B to Figure 5C). For DRG neurons of this size class, application of 5-HT resulted in a negative extracellular potential (i.e., depolarization) in 26/34 neurons tested and a positive potential (i.e., hyperpolarization-activated cation current) in 8/34 neurons tested. In 17 cases, where there were multiple cells in the field, biphasic responses were recorded. 5-HT and uncaged BHQ-O-5HT elicited the same effect for any given neuron. Application of the caged compound and uncaging could be performed repeatedly on the same neuron under perfusion conditions. No significant change in neuronal activity was observed after ejection of solvent (Ringer's solution with 1% DMSO) or BHQ-OH, or upon exposure to 1PE in the absence of BHQ-O-5HT (Figure 5B and data not shown).

Together, these results demonstrated that BHQ-O-5HT could be used to modulate the activity of mammalian neurons in culture. A cell viability assay (Freshney, 1987) showed no statistical difference (*t* test, p < 0.01) in the percentage of dying cells between BHQ-O-5HT-treated and untreated control cultures, suggesting that mammalian neurons in culture tolerate BHQ-O-5HT well.

Figure 6 depicts the results of using BHQ-O-5HT to control neural activity *in vivo*. For these experiments, zebrafish larvae were immobilized in agar at 5 days postfertilization (dpf), and solutions containing 5-HT (100 μM), BHQ-O-5HT (1 mM), or BHQ-OH (1 mM) dissolved in Ringer's solution containing 1% DMSO were microinjected in the vicinity of the maxillary nerve (Figure 6A). Electrical activity was monitored with a field electrode placed under visual guidance on the ventral aspect of the trigeminal ganglion (Figure 6A). This placement also likely detects electrical activity from the anterodorsal lateral line ganglion (Raible and Kruse, 2000). Whereas injection of 5-HT typically induced a characteristic change in the electrographic activity (n = 6/7), injection of BHQ-O-5HT did not significantly affect baseline activity until after photolysis using 365 nm light (n = 6/6). In some experiments, a short-lived electrographic response was observed immediately after injection of BHQ-O-5HT but before exposure to light, suggesting that a small amount of 5-HT was released during handling or injection; however, in these cases, exposure to light also resulted in a significant electrographic response, indicating that the majority of the compound had remained in a caged state. In these experiments, repeated exposure to light resulted in repeated induction of neural activity (Figure 6C) for up to ten trials; however, as expected, the amount of activity began to diminish with time and the number of exposures to light. This suggests that enough caged compound remained after illumination to permit repeated stimulation experiments in intact preparations. No change in baseline activity was observed after injection with BHQ-OH or by exposing the larva to flashes of light in the absence of BHQ-O-5HT. Comparable results were obtained for experiments directed toward the optic tectum (Figure S2). We observed no mortality resulting from injection or an obvious increase in cell death in the vicinity of the injection site (n = 47) during the course of the experiments, indicating that the zebrafish tolerate BHQ-O-5HT.

Because 5-HT signaling is required for LR patterning in *X. laevis* embryos (Fukumoto et al., 2005a, 2005b; Vandenberg et al., 2013), we used this endpoint and animal model to assay the physiological action of caged 5-HT molecules. To test the effects of BHQ-O-5HT on LR patterning, embryos were soaked in BHQ-O-5HT (1 mM) from the one-cell through 32-cell stage (stage 5), washed, and then both the top and bottom of the embryos were exposed to light for 1 hr using a broad-spectrum lamp to uncage 5-HT. LR patterning was assessed at stage 45 via inspection of three asymmetric organs: the heart, stomach, and gall bladder (Figure 7A). In contrast to embryos soaked in 5-HT, no LR patterning defects were observed, indicating that BHQ-O-5HT does not penetrate the cell membrane of the *Xenopus* embryo and is not taken up via the serotonin transporter (Figure 7B). Additional embryos were injected with BHQ-O-5HT at the one-cell stage, and 5-HT was uncaged starting at the 16-cell stage using the broad-spectrum lamp. LR defects including *situs inversus* and heterotaxia were observed in BHQ-O-5HT-injected embryos after uncaging with a similar percentage of affected embryos as those observed when 5-HT is injected (Figure 7C). A low rate of LR defects was also observed in embryos injected with BHQ-O-5HT that were maintained in the dark throughout the experiment, suggesting that a small amount of 5-HT is released during handling, injection, or incubation. To verify temporal control of BHQ-O-5HT uncaging, embryos were injected at the one-cell stage and then maintained in the dark until two later stages of development: 32-cell stage (stage 5) and early blastula (stage 8). Significant increases in LR patterning defects were observed only when uncaging occurred at stage 5 (Figure 7D).

Under all conditions, BHQ-O-5HT produced very low levels of toxicity, including few dead or deformed embryos or tadpoles. In experiments where embryos were soaked in BHQ-O-5HT, toxicity rates were 5%–6% either when maintained in the dark or uncaged, rates that were similar to the rates observed in untreated controls (7%, p > 0.05). Likewise, when BHQ-O-5HT was injected, low toxicity (4%–12%) was observed whether maintained in the dark or uncaged, similarly to rates observed in controls (5%–7%, p > 0.05). Injections with BHQ-OH produced few LR patterning defects (2%–3%, see Figure 7D) and little toxicity (4%–6% compared with 5% in untreated controls, p > 0.05). Soaking and injection experiments were also conducted with BHQ-N-5HT, but uncaging this molecule did not disrupt LR patterning in any experiment, regardless of which treatment route was used (data not shown). This might be due to the inability of light to penetrate the pigment in early cleavage stage embryos with enough intensity to release 5-HT from BHQ-N-5HT.


[PAGE 5] SIGNIFICANCE

Based on the ability of the BHQ protecting group to photochemically release phenol through both 1PE and 2PE, the two forms of caged 5-HT prepared, BHQ-O-5HT and BHQ-N-5HT, have higher Φu and δu values than previously reported caged 5-HTs. BHQ-O-5HT was found to be more sensitive to light at 368 and 740 nm than BHQ-N-5HT, and based on the behavior of similar compounds (Ma et al., 2012), its release kinetics is expected to be faster than diffusion rates and the opening of 5-HT3 receptors. BHQ-O-5HT mediated the light activation of 5-HT, subsequently depolarizing mammalian neurons in culture or in the nervous system of intact larval zebrafish (5–7 dpf). In the developing *Xenopus* embryo, light-induced release of 5-HT disrupted LR patterning maximally at stage 5 of development.

Taken together, these experiments demonstrate the potential of BHQ-caged 5-HT to enable the advanced study of 5-HT's physiological role in a variety of biological contexts, whole animal studies in particular. For example, BHQ-caged 5-HT could enable the exploration of mechanisms involved in the propagation of coherent neural activity (i.e., seizures) in the brain, potentially impacting our understanding of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. More broadly, BHQ-caged 5-HT could be used to explore the role of 5-HT in modulating mood, appetite, memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. In addition, 5-HT has been shown to play important roles in early developmental patterning events outside of neural tissue, such as LR patterning and melanocyte differentiation. Thus, BHQ-caged 5-HT, which can be manipulated both spatially and temporally, provides significant experimental power to dissect and understand the mechanisms behind 5-HT-mediated signaling in the developing embryo. The BHQ-caged serotonins are relatively nontoxic, have relatively little leakage, and can be released using standard laboratory equipment, enabling biologists to better probe the role of 5-HT signaling pathways in the brain and in early developmental processes.


[PAGE 5] EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
*DRG Neurons*
Dissociated primary sensory neurons were prepared from mouse DRGs as described previously (Malin et al., 2007), and plated on lysine/laminin-coated coverslips. For extracellular recordings, the slips with cells were mounted in a horizontal perfusion chamber (PC-H, Siskiyou) with a chloride-coated silver reference electrode attached, and then placed on the stage of an upright microscope (Examiner.Z1, Zeiss). Solutions of 5-HT (100 μM), BHQ-O-5HT (500 μM), or BHQ-OH (500 μM) in normal Ringer’s solution containing 1% DMSO were delivered focally to the desired cell by pressure ejection (Picospritzer II, Parker Hannifin) of 1 nl volumes from a fine-tipped glass micropipette, the tip of which was placed 100 ± 10 μm from the cell of interest. Flash photolysis was achieved using a Cairn Flash Photolysis System and OptoSource xenon and mercury/xenon mixed-gas arc light source (Cairn Research) equipped with a 365/10 nm bandpass filter (Chroma) and coupled by a fiber optic cable to the Examiner.Z1 microscope through the external port of a Colibri illumination system. Light was focused on the cells of interest using the microscope optics and water immersion lenses (20×, 40×, or 63×) with UV transmission properties. Extracellular recordings were made using glass microelectrodes (15–20 MΩ impedance) loaded with normal Ringer’s solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM HEPES [pH 7.2]) that were gently affixed to the soma by suction. Electrical activity was recorded using an Axoclamp 900a amplifier (Axon Instruments). The amplified voltage was passed through a Hum Bug Noise Eliminator (AutoMate Scientific), band-pass-filtered from 1 Hz to 0.1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440 interface and stored on a PC using pClamp version 10.3 software (Axon Instruments). For all experiments, the set-up procedure was carried out in dark room conditions at RT (23°C).

*Assessment of Toxicity*
The DRG neurons in culture were exposed to BHQ-O-5HT (1 mM) followed by incubation in the dark for 8–12 hr. Viable cell counts were made using trypan blue, a dye that is excluded from living cells (Freshney, 1987). The percentage of dead cells was determined by dividing the number of trypan blue-stained cells by the total number of cells on a 22 × 22 mm coverslip.


[PAGE 7] *Larval Zebrafish*
Larval zebrafish of the WIK strain were obtained from animals maintained in the University of Georgia Zebrafish Facility following standard procedures (Westerfield, 2007). Embryos and larvae were staged using standard staging criteria (Kimmel et al., 1995; Westerfield, 2007). All experiments conformed to the guidelines on the ethical use of animals. All experimental procedures were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines under protocols approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were designed to minimize animal suffering.

Larval zebrafish, 5 dpf, were immobilized by exposure to alpha bungarotoxin (Trapani and Nicolson, 2010) and mounted in 1.2% agarose made with normal Ringer’s solution in a 35 mm petri dish. A sharp glass microelectrode (15–20 MΩ impedance), loaded with normal Ringer’s solution, was placed under visual guidance on the ventral aspect of the trigeminal ganglion, and the chloride-coated silver reference wire was placed touching a dorsal region of the tail. For drug delivery, a second sharp glass pipette was inserted in the vicinity of the maxillary nerve. After a 2 min baseline was recorded, 0.5 nl of 5-HT (100 μM), BHQ-O-5HT (1 mM), or BHQ-OH (1 mM) dissolved in Ringer’s solution containing 1% DMSO was pressure injected (Picospritzer II), and the neurological responses were recorded. Flash photolysis was achieved, and electrical activity was recorded as described above. As with the DRG experiments, these experiments were carried out under dark room conditions and at RT.

*Assessment of Toxicity*
The mortality of the zebrafish larvae after injection of BHQ-O-5HT into the trigeminal nerve or the optic tectum was used as a measure of the toxicity of BHQ-O-5HT. Cell death at the injection site was assessed by differential interference contrast microscopy, acridine orange staining, or both.

[PAGE 7] *In Vivo* Assay of LR Patterning in *X. laevis* Embryos
*Animals*
*Xenopus* embryos were collected and fertilized according to standard protocols (Sive et al., 2000) in 0.1× modified Marc’s Ringer (MMR) at pH 7.8 containing 0.1% gentamicin and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (1967). This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by Tufts University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (M2011-70).

[PAGE 9] *Microinjection of Xenopus Embryos*
Single-cell embryos were placed in 3% Ficoll in 1× MMR and injected in the animal pole using standard methods (50–100 ms pulses with borosilicate glass needles calibrated for a bubble pressure of 50–70 kPa in water). Injections occurred under a red lamp to prevent spurious uncaging of the molecules and were otherwise protected from light. For 5-HT, 30 ng was injected; for BHQ-O-5HT, 50 ng was injected; for BHQ-OH, 40 ng was injected. After injections, embryos were washed and incubated at 18°C in the dark.

[PAGE 10] *Embryo Soaking*
Single-cell embryos were placed in 1× MMR containing 5-HT (5 mM) or BHQ-O-5HT (1 mM). Embryos were washed at stage 5 or stage 8 and returned to 0.1× MMR. After treatment, embryos were washed and kept in 0.1× MMR at 18°C in the dark.
