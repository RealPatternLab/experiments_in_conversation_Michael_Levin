ABSTRACT

Maternal use of anticonvulsants during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an elevated risk of major congenital malformations in the offspring. Whether the increased risk is caused by the specific pharmacological mechanisms of certain anticonvulsants, the underlying epilepsy, or common genetic or environmental risk factors shared by epilepsy and malformations has been controversial. We hypothesize that anticonvulsant therapies during pregnancy that attain more successful inhibition of neurotransmission might lead to both better seizure control in the mother and stronger alteration of bioelectrically-controlled processes in the embryo that result in structural malformations. We propose that development of pharmaceuticals that do not alter cell resting transmembrane voltage levels could result in safer drugs.


[PAGE 1] 1. Mechanism of pharmacologic action of anticonvulsants

The aim of anticonvulsants is to suppress the excessive firing of neurons that start a seizure to prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Drugs exert their anticonvulsant action through enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission or/and reduction of excitatory neurotransmission. The mechanism of anticonvulsant drug action is complex and remains uncertain. The main proposed mechanisms of action include: (1) Block of voltage-sensitive sodium (Na+) channels, which inhibits firing of action potentials by axons (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproate, topiramate, zonisamide). (2) Enhance the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; e.g., benzodiazepines, gabapentin, valproate, phenobarbital). (3) Block the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (e.g. lamotrigine). (4) Blockage of the T type calcium channels (e.g. ethosuximide, pregabalin).

Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. However, the magnitude of the risks and the specific abnormalities vary for each drug [1-3]. In the North American AED Pregnancy Registry, the estimated risk of major malformations overall associated with first trimester exposure ranged from 9.3% for valproate to 2.0% for lamotrigine [4]. The risk of oral clefts was over 10 per 1000 for infants exposed to phenobarbital, valproate or topiramate monotherapies, which is higher than expected based on any reference population (around 1 per 1000) [5,6].

The teratogenicity of valproic acid has been established for three decades [7-9]. It is widely accepted that first trimester exposure to valproic acid increases the risk of neural tube defects from around 1 to 10 per 1000 births [7,8,10-12]. Some studies have also suggested an association with hypospadias [8-12], oral clefts [8,10,12], cardiac septal defects [9-12], and limb defects [11,12]. Other traditional AEDs may increase the risk of malformations two to three times: primidone and its metabolite phenobarbital have been associated with oral clefts, cardiovascular and urogenital defects [13]. Although less common, oral clefts, cardiovascular defects and urogenital defects have also been reported after phenytoin therapy [14,15]. In utero exposure to carbamazepine has been associated with cleft palate [16], neural tube defects [14,16,17] hypospadias and cardiovascular defects [16].

The use of newer AEDs such as lamotrigine, topiramate and levetiracetam has increased in recent years. Studies consistently show a lower risk of malformations overall for lamotrigine than for the traditional AEDs [8,18-20]. However, the risk of oral clefts reported for lamotrigine has ranged from 1.0 to 4.5 per 1000 [4,8,20,21], and whether lamotrigine increases the risk of oral clefts is still under discussion. For topiramate, at least four studies have already suggested an increased risk of oral clefts [22-24]. There is a limited amount of information available for levetiracetam and other new generation AEDs.

In summary, most traditional and some new AEDs have been associated with relatively specific defects (i.e. oral clefts, neural tube defects, cardiac defects, and urogenital defects) to different degrees.

[PAGE 2] 3. Role of epilepsy

Evaluation of the teratogenic effects of AEDs is complicated by the fact that epilepsy itself could potentially increase the risk of birth defects [25,26]. However, the risk of malformations is higher in the offspring of women on AEDs than in those with untreated epilepsy during pregnancy [1,27,28], and women with a history of epilepsy but taking no AED do not have an increased risk of having children with major malformations [29,30]. Although these observations might reflect an effect of disease severity, since epilepsy can seldom remain untreated and untreated women might not be comparable to women on AEDs, they are also compatible with AEDs effects. Moreover, the type of epilepsy and the number of seizures during pregnancy do not affect the risk of malformations [19,27,28,31,32]. In addition, in recent years, several anticonvulsants have been increasingly used as mood stabilizers. Studies that looked at the prevalence of congenital anomalies according to indication (psychiatric vs. neurologic) suggest that the teratogenic effect is probably a drug effect rather than the epilepsy [29,30].
