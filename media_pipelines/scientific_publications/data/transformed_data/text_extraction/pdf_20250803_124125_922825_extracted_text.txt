[PAGE 2] Introduction

The scientific enterprise depends critically not only on the skills needed to definitively test crisp hypotheses,1-7 but also on the much less well-understood step of acquiring insights and fruitful research directions.⁸ Many recent discussions10,11 have focused on the fact that while modern "big data" methods are generating a deluge of facts and measurements, it is increasingly more important to be “building the edifice of science, in addition to throwing bricks into the yard".¹² In other words, it is essential that we develop strategies for deriving novel insights and deep hypotheses that cross traditional (in many cases, artificial) boundaries between disciplines. We must improve, at a pace that keeps up with technological and data science advances, our ability to identify symmetries (invariances) between sets of observations and approaches to unify and simplify where possible by identifying large-scale patterns in research literature and thus motivate and enhance new research programs (Fig. 1).

One set of tools that is being rapidly developed and ubiquitously deployed originates in the advances of the field of artificial intelligence.13-15 Machine learning is clearly poised to help science.14,16-19 It is becoming widely recognized that “robot scientist" platforms can not only provide number crunching, automation, and high throughput, but could potentially also guide research by identifying what experiments to do next.20-22 Machine learning tools have been suggested to be essential for progress in the bioinformatics of shape23-26 (moving beyond molecular information to understand organ- and organism-level form and function), and developmental biology.27,28 Not surprisingly, much emphasis is currently placed on improving the factuality of the output of AI tools; this parallels the well-developed notions of strong inference and hypothesis-testing in science: the well-established algorithm of falsifying and removing incorrect ideas. What is much less well-understood, but ultimately as crucial, is the process that provides a pool of interesting hypotheses from which to winnow until provisional truths are found. Our contribution attempts to bolster this second component of the scientific process – ideation – with a new AI-based tool for human scientists that provides input into the canonical scientific method.

Recent work in this field includes the AI-based discovery of testable models of regenerative anatomical regulation,29 which were subsequently empirically validated,30 and similar efforts in genomics,22 chemistry31,32 and biomaterials.33 One of the most potentially important current gaps is the paucity of tools for assisting with the most creative aspect of the work: identifying deep commonalities between disparate functional datasets, to enable generalized insight from the ever-growing literature. Tools are needed that would take meta-hypotheses of human scientists and mine the published studies for information that can be used to turn those conceptual hunches into actionable research programs.

One interdisciplinary area in which computer-assisted discovery would be most welcome is real-time physiology that controls form and function in vivo. How large-scale anatomy and behavior arises from the operation of molecular processes is a canonical systems biology problem.34 It is currently handled by two distinct fields, with their own educational tracks, conferences, journals, funding bodies, and paradigms: neuroscience and developmental biology. Interestingly however, recent work has suggested that these may share an important underlying set of dynamics.35-37 Neuroscience has long understood that behavior and cognition are driven by the physiological information processing by neural networks, which signal via electrical events at their membranes.38-41 Likewise, a long history of classical work has suggested that bioelectric signaling of all kinds of cells is required as an instructive set of influences that help direct complex developmental and regenerative morphogenesis.42-44 Interestingly, recent advances in the molecular understanding of developmental bioelectricity45-47 has begun to blur the boundaries between those disciplines48,49 (Fig. 2).

[PAGE 3] Specifically, it has been conjectured that the immense functional capabilities of brains have their origin in the more ancient, and slower, bioelectric networks that began operation at the emergence of bacterial biofilms50-54 and were heavily exploited by evolution to orchestrate metazoan morphogenesis.55,56 The idea that the same algorithms for scaling cellular activity into larger competencies (such as regulative morphogenesis and intelligent behavior) are used in the brain and in the body (Fig. 3) has many deep implications, for example with respect to porting methods from neuroscience and behavioral science into biomedicine,35,57,58 to take advantage of neuroscience's successful paradigms for managing multi-scale causality and inferring effective interventions.

The proposed symmetry between cellular swarms using collective dynamics to solve problems in anatomical morphospace and in 3D classical behavioral space has been empirically tested in specific contexts,34,47 and has significant implications for biomedicine and evolutionary biology.59,60 However, there has been no way to derive these hypotheses at scale from the plethora of functional literature of neuroscience and developmental biophysics. Specifically, it has been claimed that the deep similarity between the role of bioelectric networks in control of body shape (cellular collectives' behavior) and cognition (organism-level behavior) enables one to readily read neuroscience papers as if they were developmental biology papers, by only pivoting problem spaces (from 3D space to anatomical morphospace) and time scales (from milliseconds to minutes).49,56 However, there has never been an efficient way to implement this conjecture and actually explore the latent space of hypothetical papers that could provide candidate hypotheses and potentially fruitful research directions.

Here, we provide a first-generation tool, FieldSHIFT, that helps human scientists explore the mapping between developmental bioelectricity and neuroscience and begins the journey towards exploring the space of scientific studies far wider than what has already been written. FieldSHIFT is an in-context learning framework which uses a large language model to convert existing paper abstracts in neuroscience to the field of developmental biology, by appropriately replacing specific words and concepts. We show that this process generates useful, readable, insightful results that can be used to expand scientific intuition and identify testable hypotheses for novel work at the intersection of two fields. Furthermore, we test some of the resulting predictions using a bioinformatics approach, revealing a remarkable quantitative conservation of genes between developmental morphogenesis and cognitive behavior. The described system is a first step on the road to using AI tools as an imagination enhancing tool for research, deriving novel insights from expensive published experiments and letting scientists explore life-as-it-could be.61 We tested one of the predictions of its output, finding a quantitatively significant enrichment in overlap between specific genes implicated in both cognitive processes and morphogenesis.

There have been a handful of related research efforts using generative AI for hypothesis generation and cross-domain knowledge discovery. One such approach is MechGPT, a large language model for identifying and probing analogous concepts between scientific domains.62 Other approaches have focused on knowledge discovery across scientific domains, such as63 for translating between protein sequences and music note sequences with attention-based deep neural networks and64 for identifying new designs within the field of mechanical engineering via cross-domain patent mining using knowledge graphs and natural language processing. Our method focuses uniquely on generating scientific hypotheses in the form of abstracts via text translations.

[PAGE 4] Methods

We propose FieldSHIFT: a framework for domain translation with modular components in the form of training data and an AI language model for mapping text from one domain to another. We constructed a dataset of neuroscience and developmental biology sentences and associated concepts to test FieldSHIFT with two AI language models. We used trained biologists to both build the dataset and evaluate the model translations. While we focused on mapping neuroscience to developmental biology text, we believe a similar approach could be taken to apply FieldSHIFT to other domains.


[PAGE 5] Data

As an exercise with students and other researchers, the Levin Lab has been translating neuroscience to development biology, by hand, for several decades. They'd do this by changing concepts like "brain" to "body", "millisecond" to "minute", and "neuron" to "cell". We collected 70 such translation pairs. Using these concept pairs, we constructed translations varying from one sentence to abstract-length paragraphs by matching neuroscience passages with corresponding developmental biology passages. These passages include a variety of text from


[PAGE 5] Model training

Here we describe the core ideas and training procedures for the two domain translation models we used within FieldSHIFT: fine-tuned BART and GPT-4.

The core idea of the BART-based domain translator is to learn a mapping from one text domain to another.  During continued fine-tuning of the BART model, we fed two types of text pairs which we call positive and negative samples. Positive samples are neuroscience abstracts/sentences we want to translate into developmental biology abstracts/sentences, and negative samples are developmental biology abstracts/sentences which should remain untouched. This teaches the model to leave existing developmental biology texts as they are. An additional benefit of this strategy is that the model sees more examples of developmental biology text during continued fine-tuning, which comes "for free” as no human-time is required to generate these negative pairs. We sourced both from the domain translation dataset described above.

We used Beam Search with k = 5 beams to generate the next output token from the predicted probabilities of each token given by the decoder at each decoding step. We used the final predicted text sequence and the encoded ground truth text consisting of either the same developmental biology abstract as was provided as input text (for negative samples) or the corresponding output developmental biology text from a human-generated pair (for positive samples) to compute cross-entropy loss, then updated the weights of the BART encoder-decoder over many epochs of training using the AdamW optimizers74 with a learning rate of 0.00005, weight decay of 0.01, batch size per device of 1, and 128 gradient accumulation steps. We selected the final model according to cross-entropy loss on the validation set after 8 epochs of no improvement. The 503 training, 50 validation, and 57 test examples generated via our neuroscience concept split were used to train, validate, and test the model.

The core idea of the GPT-4-based domain translator is also to learn mappings from neuroscience to developmental biology text. It does this via text generation and in-context learning. When prompting the model, we provided translation example concept mappings. The full set of concepts was sourced from our domain translation dataset.

• Neuron > Cell
• Neural > Cellular
• Behavior > Morphogenesis
• Millisecond > Minute
• Msec > Min

To use the GPT-4 LLM as a domain-translator, we provided in-context examples and asked the LLM to complete the pattern. We did not update the weights of GPT-4, rather we simply ran inference using training examples within the prompt. We sampled these in-context examples from the train concepts of our domain translation dataset and validated the pattern completions on abstracts corresponding to test concepts. In this way, we measured whether GPT-4 can generalize and translate new concepts not seen among the in-context examples. We hypothesized that the very large pretraining set (much of the text on the internet) used to build GPT-4 contains many neuroscience and developmental biology concepts, and thus, the model is able to use information stored within its layers pertaining to these concepts in order to both identify new concepts from the same domain, i.e., a neuroscience concept in the test set but not in the train set, and map these concepts to developmental biology concepts not provided as sample outputs in the in-context examples.

The following illustrates how we tested GPT-4. It includes a very simple way to prompt GPT-4 to translate from neuroscience to developmental biology. It consists of our prompts and GPT responses.

[PAGE 6] Prompt

You are a translator—you translate neuroscience to developmental biology. There are deep symmetries between these fields and we want to use them to create new hypotheses in developmental biology.

The output should read as developmental biology, meaning that any neuroscience concept, such as "hippocampus", should be translated into the most relevant/related developmental biology term.

Make sure the translation makes sense as developmental biology text and is using real terms that exist in developmental biology literature.

Make sure the translation doesn't include any neuroscience words, such as a part of the brain. Do the best you can to find the most relevant translation.

For example, here are some terms and their translations:
• Neuron > Cell
• Neural > Cellular
• Behavior > Morphogenesis
• Millisecond > Minute
• Msec > Min

And here's some training data. The "prompt" is the neuroscience and "completion" is the developmental biology.

Are you ready to translate neuroscience into developmental biology?

Typical GPT response

Yes, I am ready to translate neuroscience into developmental biology. Please provide the text or concepts you would like to translate, and I will do my best to provide a relevant and accurate translation in the field of developmental biology.

We also tested a version of the GPT-4-based domain translator with chain-of-thought prompting and self-critique.85 This approach takes advantage of the chatbot interface available for GPT-4 and asks questions via multiple prompts to arrive at a final translation. We employ self-critique, asking the model to revise its initial translation, to arrive at a final translation from neuroscience to developmental biology text. In the results section, we refer to this variation of the GPT-4 domain translator as GPT-4 with self-critique.

We used the ChatGPT interface for GPT-4 provided by OpenAI with the March 23, 2023, API version. We used the default temperature of 0.7 when generating translations. Note that we used language like "are you ready to translate..." because of OpenAI and Microsoft documentation suggesting that the GPT-4 model is more effective when used in a role-playing fashion, encouraging and preparing the model like one might a human before a test.

[PAGE 7] Model validation

For each test concept in our domain translation dataset, we searched the term and chose the first abstract that included the term. Specifically, we collected one paper per test concept and selected samples using the following structure in a Google Scholar query: "(research domain)" "(specific topic)". For example, to find a paper on neurodegeneration to test, this was our search: "neuroscience” “neurodegeneration". We then selected the first result. There were five test phrases, such as "Control of anatomy by bioelectric signaling", "Change of ion channel expression” and “Axonal-dendritic chemical synapses" that didn't yield any exact matches. For those we did a follow up search for the closest matches with a query like this: "neuroscience" "Axonal-dendritic chemical synapses". We then selected the first result.

To judge the quality of the translations we had two professional cell/developmental biologists grade the text. Both annotators graded real developmental biology abstracts and GPT-4 generated abstracts using the self-critique version of the domain translator. Only one annotator graded BART-generated abstracts following initial results suggesting superiority of the GPT-4 approach. When comparing abstracts, the annotators were given the following instructions:

For each abstract you'll consider the following: does this abstract seem interesting, offering a way to think about an aspect of developmental biology or new ideas that could be investigated? The grade can either be a 1 (yes) or a 0 (no).

To sample developmental biology abstracts, we used the same concept-based search approach described above, e.g., searching for "developmental biology" "cellular". The goal was to provide a baseline understanding of how often developmental biology abstracts are seen as interesting/valuable directions of study. All abstracts were provided without specifying their origin. That is, the annotators did not know which methods generated each abstract they were grading. We report the count of 1s and 0s for each method in the results section and P-values for these counts using two-sample T-tests to compare sample proportions.

Bioinformatics
We extracted the whole set of the unique genes related to gene ontologies 'Developmental process' (GO:0032502) and 'Behavior' (GO:0007610) in humans, Drosophila, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), and the mice (Mus musculus) using Ensembl database and computed the percentage of genes of 'Behavior' included in the set of genes annotated as 'Developmental process'.86,87 As a control, we also computed the overlap between all the pairs of gene ontologies that are the children at level one of the gene ontology 'Biological process' (GO:0008150) as a control for each organism, or in other words all the gene ontologies at the same level of 'Developmental process'. We removed from the set of combinations the gene ontologies that should not be used for annotation of genes (as defined on the Gene ontology website); the removal includes: 'Regulation of biological processes' (GO:0050789), 'Negative regulation of biological process' (GO:0048519), 'Positive regulation of biological process' (GO:0048518), 'Biological regulation' (GO:0065007), 'Response to stimulus' (GO:0050896), ‘Cellular process' (GO:0009987), 'Multicellular organismal process' (GO:0032501), 'Metabolic process' (GO:0008152), 'Growth' (GO:0040007), 'Biological process involved in intraspecies interaction between organisms' (GO:0051703), and 'Biological process involved in intraspecies interaction between organisms' (GO:0044419). We applied a one-sample T-test to compare the distribution of genetic overlap between all pairs of gene ontologies we extracted and the genetic overlap between 'Developmental process' and 'Behavior' sets of genes. The code for retrieving and analyzing the data can be found at: https://github.com/LPioL/DevCog_GeneticOverlap.


[PAGE 9] Results
Comparing domain translators
A quantitative evaluation of domain translation methods via human annotation suggests the effectiveness of ML-based domain translation. According to both annotators (annotator 1 and 2), the GPT-4-based domain translator with self-critique generated good translations according to the annotation criteria for over half of the neuroscience abstracts provided. The GPT-4 approach performed significantly better than the BART approach (P = 0.017) according to annotator 1 who compared ML methods. Both annotators graded more real abstracts as good than ML-generated abstracts, however, this difference was significant only for annotator 1 (Tables 1 and 2).

While there were more false positives when generating abstracts with ML, the approach is far more scalable than humans writing abstracts. The GPT-4-based domain translator performed best of the two ML approaches tested and can output a new abstract in about five seconds. Compared to human-written abstracts, generalizing from our results, the chance of producing a good abstract is reduced by about 39%. We compute this as 1 – 20/33 where we average the 21 and 19 good translations from GPT-4 from each annotator. However, assuming these abstracts can be quickly verified and that they are sometimes very interesting and very different from humans in their content, we believe this is an incredibly useful system, enabling the generation of thousands of scientific hypotheses within a single day.

Compute budget and limited human oversight (involving less work than writing abstracts) become the main constraints on hypothesis generation using this ML-based approach to domain translation. Additional constraints may include the diversity of input papers and an upper bound on the total number of symmetries between domains of which GPT-4 is aware. While these claims warrant further research and our results represent initial findings, the value of ML-based domain translation is promising given the inherent ability to scale.

The inter-annotator agreement for the combined set of GPT-4 with self-critique and real abstracts was 0.639 with Cohen's Kappa 0.235. The low Cohen's Kappa indicates the subjectivity of this exercise, even when grading real developmental biology abstracts. Future work may look to increase the number of annotators or annotations for comparing domain translation methods (Table 3).

We found no difference between GPT-4 and GPT-4 with self-critique according to an evaluation from the first annotator. It's possible future work on the series of prompts used for self-critique could improve model performance. We leave this as future work.


[PAGE 9] Examples of abstracts generated
Examining some specific cases, BART and GPT performed the best when translating words in or near the space of words they'd seen before. Specific neuroscience terms that often don't have clear translations such as “trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias" would often be erroneously translated or not translated at all. One of the most interesting translations was the following:

Input: The brain forms cognitive maps of relational knowledge-an organizing principle thought to underlie our ability to generalize and make inferences. However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and predictive cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes the experienced transition structure. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial map and a weakening of the predictive map. This change is driven by the orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the degree to which an outcome is consistent with the spatial rather than the predictive map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.

GPT-4: Morphogenetic gradients are an organizing principle thought to underlie the ability to direct and coordinate cellular behaviors during development. However, how can a relevant gradient be selected in situations where a stimulus influences multiple spatial structures? Here, we find that both spatial and predictive morphogenetic gradients govern the coordination of cell differentiation and tissue organization, with spatial location determining cell fate. Mirroring morphogenesis, the organizer region not only establishes a gradient of spatial relationships but also encodes the transition structure experienced during development. As development progresses, cellular behaviors become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial gradient and a weakening of the predictive gradient. This change is driven by the signaling center, which represents the degree to which a morphogenetic event is consistent with the spatial rather than the predictive gradient and updates organizer region representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how morphogenetic gradients in the organizer region are used and updated flexibly for directing cellular behaviors during development.

This is a very interesting translation, because it suggests the use of a predictive coding model (a predictive gradient) to understand progressive morphogenesis.  This is testable, as biophysical or biochemical representations of cell expectations (homeostatic setpoints, in the sense of priors) can be looked for experimentally.

To illustrate the abilities and struggles of the two domain translation models, below are three translation examples, from easy to difficult. Both approaches correctly translated the first, only GPT-4 correctly translated the second, and neither correctly translated the third.

"Neurogeneration" test – easy
Input: In parallel to recent developments of genetic techniques, understanding of the syndromes of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation has grown considerably...
GPT-4: In parallel to recent developments of genetic techniques, understanding of the syndromes of cellular degeneration with tissue iron accumulation has grown considerably...
BART: In parallel to recent developments of genetic techniques, understanding of the syndromes of cellular degeneration with tissue iron accumulation has grown considerably...

"Nervous system" test – medium
Input: We tested the hypothesis that the nervous system, and the cortex in particular, is a critical determinant of muscle strength/weakness...
GPT-4: We tested the hypothesis that the cellular system, and the tissue organization in particular, is a critical determinant of cell behavior regulation...
BART: We tested the hypothesis that the nervous system, and the cortex in particular, is a critical determinant of muscle strength/weakness...

"Autonomic reflexes" test - hard
Input: The trigeminal autonomic reflex is a physiologic reflex that plays a crucial role in primary headache and particularly in trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias...
GPT-4: The trigeminal autonomic reflex is a physiological reflex that plays a crucial role in primary tissue growth and particularly in trigeminal-autonomic tissue formation...
BART: The trigeminal autonomic reflex is a physiologic reflex that plays a crucial role in primary headache and particularly in remodeling of the epithelium and particularly tissues...

The examples above show BART and GPT-4 have an easier time translating words they've seen in the training data than esoteric neuroscience words they haven't seen. They also show the kinds of translations that set GPT-4 apart in our experiments. For example, in the medium case, GPT-4 translated "cortex" into “tissue organization", while our BART model didn't recognize "cortex" as a neuroscience word and attempt to translate it.


[PAGE 11] Hypothesis testing: molecular conservation between cognition and morphogenesis

One clear hypothesis that can be generated by FieldSHIFT is that the molecular mechanisms behind developmental bioelectricity and that of cognitive/behavioral phenomena should be conserved. That is, the same genes should be found as implicated in both roles; this is novel because only the idea of "morphogenesis as behavior in anatomical space" predicts any association between genes across what are normally thought of as two very distinct fields of biology. Interestingly, GPT (August 3rd version of GPT-4) itself generated this hypothesis after doing all the translations and being asked to come up with a new idea as follows:

Input: (Base input as described above) You are a translator-you translate neuroscience to developmental biology...
Input: Let's start by generating a hypothesis based on everything you know about developmental biology and genetics; instead of making a translation, generate a novel and testable hypothesis about the genes involved in learning and morphogenesis.

Reply: There exists a set of evolutionarily conserved genes that are activated both during early morphogenetic processes and later in the organism's life during learning and memory formation. These genes mediate cellular plasticity mechanisms, which are vital for both the formation of complex body structures during embryonic development and the flexibility and adaptability of mature organisms to new environmental stimuli.

Thus, we next decided to test this prediction using bioinformatics, focusing for the purposes of this study on the genes thought to underlie phenomena in behavioral science and developmental biology.

We computed the genetic overlap between the set of genes annotated as 'Behaviour' and the set of genes annotated as 'Developmental process' in different species widely dispersed within the phylogenetic tree including Drosophila, zebrafish, mice and homo sapiens. We found that 74.1% of the 'Behavior' genes (649 genes) are included in the 'Developmental process' set of genes (6486 genes). From Drosophila to humans, this genetic overlap is increasing: 46.5% for Drosophila, 60.6% for the zebrafish, 73.8% for the mouse and 74.1% for humans (see Fig. 6A and B). We applied a one-sample T-test to compare the distribution of genetic overlap between all pairs of gene ontologies we extracted and the genetic overlap between 'Developmental process' and 'Behavior' sets of genes for each organism. Statistical analysis of overlap among all pairs of gene ontologies (at the same level of 'Developmental process') for these four organisms is significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than the overlap we observed among the predictive categories of development and behavior. Thus, we conclude that during evolution there is an increase of the genetic overlap between 'Behavior' and 'Developmental process'. In other words, genes used for development and morphogenesis have been co-opted for cognition. The mapping between behavior and development/morphogenesis can also be seen at the genetic level.


[PAGE 12] Discussion

Machine learning for domain translation
We proposed FieldSHIFT, a framework for domain translation. To implement FieldSHIFT, we built a domain translation dataset and compared two ML approaches for domain translation using this data and expert evaluation of the translations. Expert evaluation identified that the GPT-4-based approach produced good translations, leading to a useful hypothesis or insight about developmental biology, in about 20 out of every 33 tries. This suggests that new hypotheses in developmental biology can be produced at scale in an automated fashion, using humans to review and extend the initial ideas. We found that curating a high-quality dataset and designing prompts was the bulk of the work for making the system effectively translate between domains.

While the GPT-4-based approach which used in-context learning performed better than the BART-based approach, the recent public release of open-source LLMs such as Llama and Falcon present opportunities to perform domain translation by fine-tuning on arbitrarily many examples of translated text. BART is an early LM for text generation, though its size makes it a cost-effective choice compared to fine-tuning a large, open-source LLM. Still, because the exact implementation of the GPT-4 LLM is not publicly disclosed, and because fine-tuning can provide greater control and performance on specific tasks than in-context learning, future efforts should consider the use of open LLM architectures for domain translation. We note also that multimodal strategies for training and applying LLMs to a mix of image and text data could be valuable for domain translation. In addition to example abstracts or articles, researchers could include images or videos pertaining to experiments or experimental findings as input to a system like FieldSHIFT, or a domain translator could output images or video clips in addition to text as literal visions of scientific hypothesis and their potential outcomes.


[PAGE 12] Bioelectricity: conserved mechanisms and algorithms between control of body and behavior
It has been previously hypothesized that the algorithms of behavior (active inference, perceptual control, collective decision-making, memory and learning, navigation of problem spaces, preferences, pursuit of goal states with degrees of flexible response, etc.) are used to direct morphogenesis and may even derive from it evolutionarily.  Here, we produce a tool that can be used to explore the symmetries and commonalities between these two fields, and in fact any other two fields. By translating abstracts of papers from one set of vocabulary into another, we generate new ways to think about data and potential new hypotheses. We show here that this works in the case of the parallels between behavioral science and the science of morphogenesis, and generated a specific new hypothesis: not only the algorithms, but the molecular mechanisms (genes) are also conserved. While empirical (functional) testing will be needed to conclusively test this idea, we performed bioinformatics experiments that generated new data supporting the hypothesis: implications of the same genes between the topics of morphogenesis and cognition occurs at a frequency much greater than between other random categories of genes. This finding thus suggests a number of genes and their products to be tested in novel morphogenetic assays using genetic and pharmacological tools. This work is currently under way in our lab.


[PAGE 12] Latent space of scientific papers
We believe that this work is just the beginning of the AI-guided exploration of the latent space around scientific papers, in the sense of the "adjacent possible”.  Each real scientific paper in the literature provides access to an associated set of possible papers in which one or more aspects are changed in effect, exploring various symmetries of concepts in specific problem spaces. These papers are not meant to be taken literally, since they do not provide real-world data, but instead as tools to spur creativity, provide testable novel hypotheses, suggest studies to be carried out, and perhaps most importantly, by reflecting approaches from specific studies into different disciplines, dissolve barriers between fields and knowledge silos. These "virtual" papers are not published in scientific journals (which should be reserved for studies that have actually been carried out), but are accessible via machine learning and represent another useful repository (whose goal is to advance creativity and novel thinking a second-order function complementing first order traditional papers containing specific knowledge and data). While it is essential for the scientific literature to be clearly demarcated as to whether a study was actually done or is only hypothetical, we believe that maintaining artificial barriers between the creative ideation and hypothesis testing phases of science is counterproductive. An early example of this realization came from the James V. McConnell (discoverer of the ability of memories to move through tissues), who edited a journal called The Journal of Biological Psychology which contained peer-reviewed primary papers in one half of each issue, while the second half (printed up-side-down) contained perspectives, drawings, poetry, etc.


[PAGE 13] Limitations of the study and next steps
One limitation of the study is the number of papers we were able to manually curate; the machine learning will improve as more papers are added in the future. Especially with the rapid development in large language models, we can expect significant improvements in the quality of output in the future. While a number of ways exist in which machine learning may disrupt current scientific structures, the platform described herein can be safely utilized to generate candidate research programs, as long as it is clearly kept in mind that the system we describe is not claimed to generate truths by analysis of existing data; it is a system for generating novel hypotheses that must be empirically tested.

While the current evaluation is based on human assessments of the quality of translations between the fields of neuroscience and developmental biology, we acknowledge that experimental validation of generated hypotheses would be necessary to fully realize the power of our method. That is, a complete evaluation of FieldSHIFT would require conducting experiments to address hypotheses from our domain translator and assessing the value of the findings relative to human-generated experimental directions. Not only the findings of the experiments but also the methods, complexity, and feasibility of testing FieldSHIFT-generated hypotheses should be compared to human-directed research. Work of this kind is already underway at the Levin Lab, and we look forward to sharing these results in future work.


[PAGE 13] Conclusion

The increased overlap we observed between genes implicated in morphogenesis and behavior has a number of implications for experimental work on the evolution and biomedical targeting of many of those genes. More broadly, our approach has identified a method for generating testable hypotheses in the space of developmental bioelectricity, which has implications for birth defects, traumatic injury, and cancer.57,105-107 Future work will incorporate this kind of workflow into machine science pipelines, and empirically test the creative products of exploring the structures of concepts among diverse fields of inquiry. It is clear however that this approach in exploring the latent space around existing scientific literature extends far beyond bioelectricity and can be applied to numerous domains. Machine learning and AI are poised to significantly potentiate every aspect of research.20,21,108-110 One of the critical roles will be not as mere number crunching, but as an essential aid to the first key step: hypothesis generation. We foresee extremely fruitful collaborations between naturally evolved (human scientists) and engineered (AI) scientists.
