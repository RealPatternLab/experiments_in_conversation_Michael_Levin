[PAGE 1] What's Left in Asymmetry?

Left-right patterning is a fascinating problem of morphogenesis, linking evolutionary and cellular
signaling mechanisms across many levels of organization. In the past 15 years, enormous progress has been
made in elucidating the molecular details of this process in embryos of several model species. While many
outside the field seem to believe that the fundamental aspects of this pathway are now solved, workers on
asymmetry are faced with considerable uncertainties over the details of specific mechanisms, a lack of
conceptual unity of mechanisms across phyla, and important questions that are not being pursued in
any of the popular model systems. Here, we suggest that data from clinical syndromes, cryptic
asymmetries, and bilateral gynandromorphs, while not figuring prominently in the mainstream work on
LR asymmetry, point to crucial and fundamental gaps of knowledge about asymmetry. We identify 12 big
questions that provide exciting opportunities for fundamental new advances in this field.

[PAGE 1] INTRODUCTION

Left-right (LR) asymmetry is an im-
portant and puzzling feature of em-
bryogenesis (Burdine and Schier,
2000; Levin, 2005), also having impor-
tant implications for human health
and development (Cohen, 2001; Rams-
dell, 2005). There now seems to be a
perception outside the field that the
question of LR patterning is largely
solved. Cell biology textbooks and re-
views now often summarize their view
of the situation with one sentence,
such as "... and ciliary movement also
initiates Left-Right patterning". This
is unfortunate, because it leads young
developmental biologists (and review-
ers of grant proposals) to think that
there is little interesting science left
in this field. However, those working
on LR patterning know that there is
considerable uncertainty about the
early mechanisms of symmetry break-
ing, the evolutionary origins and de-
gree of conservation of LR mecha-
nisms at all levels, and the clinical
implications of what we know and do
not know about asymmetry (Tabin,
2005; Levin, 2006; Raya and Bel-
monte, 2006; Speder et al., 2007).

The study of LR patterning has
largely been focused on the asymmet-
ric gene cascades (Levin, 1998; Whit-
man and Mercola, 2001), understand-
ing the dynamics of node cilia using
technologically intricate approaches
(Cartwright et al., 2004; Buceta et al.,
2005), and modeling the properties of
morphogen gradients of Nodal (Naka-
mura et al., 2006). However, a constel-
lation of classic and recent observa-
tions suggests that, contrary to
popular opinion, we are still missing
major components of this field, and, in
many ways, have been looking "where
the light is good".

Here, we briefly sketch 12 major
open questions in an effort to catalyze
work on these challenging and novel
directions. We chose these specific is-
sues to be distinct in nature from the
many details that remain to be fleshed
out regarding the known pathways.
The major areas of ignorance are re-
vealed because they are not currently
being addressed, have no established
powerful model for their investiga-
tion, and/or involve a complex phe-
nomenon not centered on a specific
gene product. While we highlight
some of the most difficult issues facing
the field, these are also the areas of
the greatest opportunity for discovery
of new biology in this field.


[PAGE 2] (1) What is the molecular mech-
anism of "concordance" that deter-
mines whether a population is 50%
situs inversus and 50% situs solitus vs.
heterotaxic (random and independent
sidedness of each organ)? Perturba-
tions, like the spontaneous mouse mu-
tants iv and lgl (Layton, 1976; Mc-
Neish et al., 1990; Singh et al., 1991),
and patients with immotile cilia syn-
drome (Afzelius, 1976), exhibit 50% si-
tus inversus and 50% situs solitus,
while almost all of the known manip-
ulations of early pathways (and mam-
malian mutations of Zic3, Lefty, cryp-
tic/CFC, and ActRIIb) result in
heterotaxia. None of the existing mod-
els (ciliary or intracellular) specifi-
cally address this; nor do they provide
an explanation for how heterotaxia oc-
curs. Thus, a more careful character-
ization of known mutations as to their
degree of concordance (by scoring ad-
ditional organ readouts and paying at-
tention to subtle organ malformations
as well as overall reversals), and the
development of models that make pre-
dictions about the timing and nature
of independent vs. linked situs deci-
sions, will be essential.

(2) What is the base state of the
LR axis? Complete inversions are in-
duced by partial deletion of inv (Mo-
chizuki et al., 1998), overexpression of
mature Vg1 (Hyatt and Yost, 1998),
and inhibition of serotonin receptor 3
(albeit with a lower penetrance; Fuku-
moto et al., 2005). The inv mouse is
especially curious, because its muta-
tion results in the majority of its off-
spring exhibiting situs inversus (al-
though there is a detectable level of
heterotaxia; Morgan et al., 1998; Otto
et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the true
genetic deletion has not been analyzed
and all published experiments appear
to have been carried out with the
spontaneous mutant, in which a small
part of the protein still exists (and
hence may not be a true null). Thus, it
remains to be determined whether
this fragment is enough to bias asym-
metry, refuting the bizarre possibility
that the default state (without INV
activity) is biased asymmetry, but in
the reverse orientation, and that the
INV gene product is needed to simply
flip everything in the complete oppo-
site direction. The inv mutation ap-
pears to affect a very early step, be-
cause a cross between an inv mouse
and a Foxj1 knockout mouse (knock-
out Foxj1 mice are 50% situs inversus
and 50% situs solitus; Chen et al.,
1998; Brody et al., 2000; Zhang et al.,
2004) produce mice that more closely
resemble the Foxj1 phenotype (Tama-
koshi et al., 2006). An understanding
of the definitive inv loss-of-function
should be very informative.

Recent studies show that retinoic
acid signaling isolates somites from
asymmetric cues (Vermot et al., 2005;
Vermot and Pourquie, 2005). Symmet-
rical structures may inadvertently be
susceptible to the effects of LR signal-
ing molecules, because many develop-
mentally important factors are used
in patterning programs that overlap
in space and time. The advantages of
symmetry, however, have selected for
the evolution of processes that shield
the developing symmetric structures
from asymmetric cues (Vermot et al.,
2005; Vermot and Pourquie, 2005).
Along with the orientation, it should
be determined whether the base state
of symmetrical structures is symme-
try or asymmetry (Jefferies et al.,
1996; Palmer, 2004).

[PAGE 2] (3) Are the breaking and orien-
tation steps truly distinct and se-
quential? It is commonly thought
that to pattern the LR axis, symmetry
must first be broken and then oriented
with respect to the other two axes
(Brown and Wolpert, 1990). However,
sometimes, perturbation of the same
molecule in different locations can
lead to predictable, differential later-
ality phenotypes. Ventral injection of
chimeric BVg1 into the R3 cells causes
almost complete situs inversus, while
injection into the R1 cell causes het-
erotaxia, and injections into the left
side do not cause any significant lat-
erality defects (Hyatt and Yost, 1998).
These data may indicate a close rela-
tionship between the mechanisms for
the breaking of symmetry and the bi-
asing of asymmetry, and could serve
as an entry point into this process.
Precedents for such a bistable switch
include the Notch/Delta system (Raya
et al., 2004). Regardless of whether
the breaking of symmetry and biasing
of asymmetry is one step or two steps,
the iv mutant mouse, which exhibits
random 50% situs inversus and 50%
situs solitus, indicates that the next
processes of amplification and restric-
tion of the initial asymmetric signal
may still be able to receive cues from,
or act downstream of the symmetry
breaking point, and that the orienta-
tion mechanism may not be necessary
to bridge the symmetry breaking
point with concordant downstream or-
gan morphogenesis. This makes sense
evolutionarily; the direction of asym-
metry is not as important as concor-
dance between the organs, because si-
tus inversus individuals exhibit few
clinical symptoms, but heterotaxic in-
dividuals can often have severe medi-
cal problems (Burn, 1991; Peeters and
Devriendt, 2006).

A related aspect is the precise char-
acterization of phenotypes reported
for the various genetic and pharmaco-
logical perturbations. To arrive at a
complete model for LR patterning
mechanisms, detailed characteriza-
tion of the phenotypes caused by each
experimental system is essential. In-
deed, both iv and inv mouse pheno-
types are not purely 50%/50% and
fully inverted respectively, but in-
clude a significant degree of hetero-
taxias, isomerisms, and cardiac mal-
formations (Hummel and Chapman,
1959; Morgan et al., 1998; Morishima
et al., 1998; McQuinn et al., 2001).
Likewise, situs inversus individuals
are not really normal with respect to
cardiac function because of discor-
dances of orientation of structures at
different scales (Delhaas et al., 2004;
Ramsdell, 2005). Thus, the distinc-
tions between symmetry breaking,

[PAGE 3] orientation, and concordance/morpho-
genesis may be more artifacts of our
conceptual analysis of LR patterning
phenotypes than a reflection of truly
separate mechanisms during embryo-
genesis.

(4) Probably related is a set of
puzzling inconsistencies about
the universally conserved Left de-
terminant Nodal, other asymmet-
ric genes, and downstream read-
outs. If Nodal is indeed a Left
determinant, why does bilateral
Nodal not lead to left isomerism, but
to randomization (Levin et al., 1997;
Sampath et al., 1997)? What kind of
mechanism could explain cases where
the upstream markers exhibit a
higher level of incorrectly sided ex-
pression then the downstream targets
they induce in the LR cascade (Tsukui
et al., 1999; Kitaguchi et al., 2000;
Kelly et al., 2002; Levin et al., 2002;
Morokuma et al., 2002), which may
even become completely uncoupled
from expression of Nodal (Cota et al.,
2006)? Because the iv mouse exhibits
50% situs inversus and 50% situs soli-
tus, we would expect nodal expression
in the iv mouse population to be 50%
left-sided, and 50% right-sided. In-
stead, Nodal in iv mice populations is
expressed on the left-side, right-side,
bilateral or absent, at statistically
equal probabilities (Lowe et al., 1996).
This finding indicates that, in iv mice,
bilateral or absent Nodal does not pre-
vent organ concordance. Yet, when
left-sided Nodal is experimentally re-
moved, heterotaxia does result (Bren-
nan et al., 2002)! In zebrafish, over
30% of cup mutant embryos show
complete situs inversus, but only a
small percentage of them show right-
sided spaw expression (Schottenfeld
et al., 2007), even though cup is a ho-
molog of Pkd2 which is thought to be
upstream of Nodal signaling. Another
related puzzle: why do as many as
20% of siblings from a batch of em-
bryos with 99% normal organ situs ex-
hibit no expression of Nodal whatso-
ever (Levin and Mercola, 1998a;
Takano et al., 2007)?

(5) How conserved are the early,
intermediate, and late mecha-
nisms in LR patterning? The vari-
ous intracellular, biophysical, and cil-
iary mechanisms have each only been
probed in a small number of represen-
tative model systems (Palmer, 2004;
Levin, 2006; Levin and Palmer, 2007).
While cilia appear to be involved in
mouse (Nonaka et al., 1998; McGrath
et al., 2003), zebrafish (Otto et al.,
2003; Amack and Yost, 2004), and Xe-
nopus (Schweickert et al., 2007), nu-
merous other mechanisms such as cy-
toskeletal polarity (Thitamadee et al.,
2002; Qiu et al., 2005), serotonergic
signaling (Fukumoto et al., 2005), gap
junctions (Levin and Mercola, 1998a,
1999; Chuang et al., 2007), and ion
flows (Adams et al., 2006) are con-
served in LR patterning among other
phyla, including Arabidopsis, Dro-
sophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and
ciliates (Levin and Palmer, 2007;
Oviedo and Levin, 2007). The recent
demonstration that individual cells
can align the LR axis from intracellu-
lar polarity cues (Xu et al., 2007) sug-
gests that subcellular and ancient
chiral components of all cells may un-
derlie an origin of LR patterning ex-
isting before the evolution of multicel-
lularity. This powerful idea was
presciently suggested in 1977, before
the identification of any of the molec-
ular aspects of asymmetry: "one may
begin to look for a relationship be-
tween the bilateral symmetry of or-
ganisms and the mirror symmetry be-
tween daughter cells at an early state
of the embryo" (Albrecht-Buehler,
1977).

The question of which, if any, of the
early physiological mechanisms are
used in mouse asymmetry is still open
(see Levin and Palmer, 2007 for a dis-
cussion of alternative interpretations
of the genetic data vis-a-vis the pro-
posal of cilia as originators of asym-
metry). Because of the ubiquitous
compensation and redundancy that
exists among ion transport machin-
ery, a truly satisfactory approach to
answering this would require
knock-in of dominant negative and
constitutively active transporter mu-
tants that will change cell membrane
potential in prestreak embryos in
well-defined ways, rather than knock-
out of individual channel/pump genes.
Related to this is the need to re-exam-
ine roles of "ciliary" proteins in mam-
mals, as they are likely to have other
functions in addition to ciliary roles,
and hence, knockouts do not cleanly
implicate a specific function of ciliary
proteins in LR patterning. For exam-
ple, LRD is expressed in a random
manner in head folds (Supp et al.,
1997), and, intriguingly, has been
shown to be important for biased chro-
matid segregation (Armakolas and
Klar, 2007).


[PAGE 3] (6) What explains the relatively
low “penetrance” of some lateral-
ity-perturbing reagents and mu-
tations? In a population where the
background of defects is ~1%, a 25%
incidence of heterotaxia in 1,000 em-
bryos is unquestionably significant
(Levin and Mercola, 1998a; Levin et
al., 2002; Bunney et al., 2003). But,
are the remaining embryos insensi-
tive to the reagent? Are they somehow
regulating to normalize asymmetry
despite the effect of the reagent? Or
are they truly part of an "affected"
group of which 75% are developmen-
tally determined to be situs solitus?
With respect to pharmacological inhi-
bition of ion channels and transport-
ers, a possible reason for this may
relate to the existence of robust phys-
iological homeostasis mechanisms
that can compensate for the loss of
channel function, or even that the pre-
cise repertoire of functioning trans-
porters expressed in a given individ-
ual may be a complex function of
heredity, diet, and culture conditions
that remain to be worked out. For ex-
ample (unpublished observations in
our lab), a pharmacological reagent
from the same aliquot, on the same
day, when applied to embryos of two
different mothers, can cause hetero-
taxia rates of 3% to one group, and
55% in the other! This type of result
reveals the complexity underlying the
simple question of whether a particu-
lar pathway is or is not "involved in
LR patterning."

One possible explanation for the
variability in phenotypes may involve
the early embryonic fate-map. Some
organisms (e.g., C. elegans) have a
very mosaic and stereotypical devel-
opment; others (e.g., Xenopus) use a
basic scheme in which blastomeres
give rise to which tissues, but the ex-
act cell boundaries vary considerably
among individuals of normal egg
batches. This is clearly seen in the
original data sets of fate mapping
studies (Dale and Slack, 1987; Moody
and Kline, 1990; Chalmers and Slack,

[PAGE 4] 2000). One prediction of this model is
that a meta-analysis of LR perturba-
tions among phyla should show more
variability in phenotypic outcome in
model species whose development is
less stereotypical. If true, this would
also suggest the existence of endoge-
nous robustness mechanisms compen-
sating for high levels of plasticity in
embryonic cell fate (Palmer, 2004).
Importantly, an understanding of
these robustness mechanisms will
also improve our ability to investigate
LR patterning, because it is still not
known why laboratory culture of ro-
dent and flatfish embryos automati-
cally results in a significant back-
ground of LR defects (Fujinaga et al.,
1990; Fujinaga and Baden, 1991;
Schreiber, 2006). The understanding
of stability against, and susceptibility
to, environmental factors in LR pat-
terning will be a key component of a
complete appreciation of the stochas-
ticity underlying consistent asymme-
try.

(7) What is the nature of "sub-
tle" asymmetries? The field is al-
most entirely focused on pathways de-
termining situs of heart and visceral
organs, with some attention now be-
ing paid to laterality of the brain
(Toga and Thompson, 2003; Halpern
et al., 2005; Sun and Walsh, 2006;
Hendricks and Jesuthasan, 2007).
Central nervous system asymmetry
may be patterned differently from
that of body asymmetry, along path-
ways that may either be unrelated but
parallel or, more likely, divergent
from a common early step: although
humans with situs inversus exhibit re-
versal of some anatomical brain asym-
metries, they do not show reversals in
functional asymmetries, and establish
language dominance on the left cere-
bral hemisphere and a strong bias for
right-handedness, just like in the gen-
eral population (Kennedy et al., 1999;
Tanaka et al., 1999; McManus et al.,
2004). The zebrafish model system
has not provided an ideal model for
this discordance, because changes in
canonical visceral situs pathways do
seem to randomize fish brain asymme-
try (Bisgrove et al., 2000; Concha et
al., 2000; Barth et al., 2005; Essner et
al., 2005), although point mutations of
cyclops (the zebrafish Nodal homolog)
result in normal heart looping and vis-
ceral situs but perhaps anatomical
randomization in the brain because
asymmetric gene expression is altered
(Saude et al., 2005). However, the clin-
ical data indicate that numerous other
body structures and processes pay at-
tention to LR cues, in pathways not
predicted by or included in any of the
current models (ciliary or intracellu-
lar).

There are several human syn-
dromes that affect symmetrical or
paired structures like the limbs
(Smith et al., 1979), face or hips (Pau-
lozzi and Lary, 1999), that consis-
tently present more strongly on one
side than the other. Facial clefting pre-
sents a consistent asymmetry (Delaney
and Boyd, 2007), and this condition has
recently become experimentally tracta-
ble, with the identification of molecular
markers of asymmetry in symmetrical
embryonic structures (somites; Golding
et al., 2004a,b), and the discovery of a
genetic entry point into zebrafish
craniofacial asymmetry (Albertson and
Yelick, 2005). Hemihyperplasia (Frau-
meni et al., 1967; Clericuzio, 1993;
Leung et al., 2002), a rare phenomenon
where one side of the body to begins to
grow in adulthood, is right-biased
(Hoyme et al., 1998), and not only sug-
gests that symmetric structures (knee
joints, long bones of the legs) have LR
identity, but that, astonishingly, they
are able to retain that information for
decades after embryogenesis.

Monozygotic twins are discordant
for hemihypertrophy (West et al.,
2003), and they display opposite-sided
hair whorl direction, unilateral tooth
defects, and other "bookending" phe-
nomena (reviewed in Levin, 1999),
strengthening the link between very
early chiral decisions and subtle
asymmetries in man. Is this related to
the mirroring (Fig. 1) of cytoskeletal
structures and migration paths ob-
served when cells split (Albrecht-
Buehler, 1977)? What is the molecular
nature of the asymmetrical informa-
tion that exists at early cleavages of
vertebrate embryos and that results
in asymmetry defects in one of the
twins when they are separated early?
Why does this separation result in op-
posite sidedness of subtle characteris-
tics such as hair whorls in man (Gol-
bin et al., 1993Aa,b; Morison et al.,
1994) but also affect visceral and car-
diac situs in some vertebrates
(Mangold, 1921; Takano et al., 2007)?
An entry point into the mechanisms of
these subtle asymmetries may be pro-
vided by the study of hair whorls on
the face of cattle produced by egg
splitting (in the context of on-going in
vitro production of valuable animals;
Ozil et al., 1982; Gatica et al., 1984;
Lanier et al., 2001; Meola et al., 2004).
Does the fact that these subtle asym-
metries in human monozygotic twins
exist almost entirely above the neck

[PAGE 5] suggest a separate LR-organizer for
the head and brain, distinct from that
for the body?

The link to sex determination path-
ways (which have no obvious asymme-
try) is fascinating, revealed by the
consistently sided presence of testes
vs. ovaries in hermaphrodites (van
Niekerk and Retief, 1981; Krob et al.,
1994; Mittwoch, 2000, 2001, 2008).
There is a cryptic asymmetry aspect to
sex determination; for example, the
consistent asymmetry in foot size is
opposite between women and men
(Levy and Levy, 1978). A model sys-
tem may be available, because, in the
Zic3 mutant, all affected males are
heterotaxic, while females are wild-
type or situs inversus (Gebbia et al.,
1997). Finally, there are associations
between asymmetry and the immune
response (Renoux et al., 1983; Fride et
al., 1990; Betancur et al., 1991;
Neveu, 2002; Fu et al., 2003; Meador
et al., 2004; Quaranta et al., 2004;
Shen et al., 2005), and cancer (McMa-
nus, 1992; Sandson et al., 1992). The
origin and implications of these links
remain completely mysterious.

(8) "What is randomization"?
This is a term often used in the field
but attempting to construct a logical,
mechanistic model of randomization
quickly reveals our lack of conceptual
clarity. For example, the normal chick
embryo has a depolarization of cells on
the left side of the streak followed by
expression of Sonic hedgehog on the
left side of the node. The simple way of
modeling this would be to hypothesize
that depolarization induces Shh ex-
pression. However, experimental in-
duction of bilateral depolarization
(Levin et al., 2002) does not result in
bilateral Shh, but instead gives a
spectrum of left-sided, right-sided, bi-
lateral, and absent Shh expression. A
mechanistic understanding of ran-
domization would not only have to ex-
plain this bizarre result (which also
occurs for other LR components), but
would also have to show how cells are
synchronized (so that the L and R do-
mains of Hensen's node act as a unit,
and do not exhibit a salt-and-pepper
pattern on each side, reflecting cells'
individual randomization). It would
also need to predict the nonequiprob-
able outcomes (right-sided Shh is less
frequent than bilateral Shh for exam-
ple).

(9) What happens upstream of
asymmetric gene expression in
the chick? Before the right-sided ex-
pression of Activin Receptor IIa in the
early chick streak (Levin et al., 1995;
Stern et al., 1995), there are no nodal
cilia, and the subsequent serotonin lo-
calization does not match the asym-
metric pattern described in Xenopus
(Fukumoto et al., 2005). Yet, many of
the same molecular components are
involved serotonin and its receptors,
gap junctions, and the H,K-ATPase/V-
ATPase system (Levin, 2005). How
are the same molecular signaling ele-
ments implemented in a body plan
with a completely different large-scale
architecture and cell size? Is the dif-
ferential timing of similar physiologi-
cal mechanisms among Xenopus and
chick an instance of evolutionary het-
erochrony? Might the temporal sliding
of molecular LR components relative
to other embryonic events explain the
evolutionary differences and similari-
ties observed in asymmetry across
phyla? Finally, what is the role of mo-
lecular chirality in amniotes, given
that application of nonbiological ste-
reoisomers of simple molecules in-
duces heterotaxia in chick (Gray et al.,
1942)?

(10) Is there a LR coordinator or
organizer? In many types of em-
bryos, LR patterning first takes place
in a sheet of cells; it has been sug-
gested that the information originates
locally-in a kind of organizer or LR
coordinator that is a single cell or
small group of cells. This organizer is
suggested to be in early blastomeres
in Xenopus (Hyatt and Yost, 1998), in
the node in mice (Pagan-Westphal
and Tabin, 1998) and in the base of
the primitive streak in chick (Levin
and Mercola, 1998b). One proposal
has been that LR patterning is a kind
of planar cell polarity (Aw et al.,
2008), as occurs in Drosophila wings
and hair cells of the inner ear in mam-
mals (Axelrod and McNeill, 2002;
Zallen, 2007), and is a mechanism by
which an organizer imposes a coher-
ent LR directionality on the rest of the
blastoderm. However, the ability of in-
dividual mammalian cells to set up a
consistent LR polarity within a single
cell (Xu et al., 2007), and the long-
known ability of ciliates to epigeneti-
cally establish handedness (Nelsen et
al., 1989) suggest that perhaps cells
can independently orient their intra-
cellular directionality along the LR
axis. It will be crucial to determine
whether LR information (including di-
rection of the L and R sides, and posi-
tion with respect to the midline) is
imposed from without or generated in-
ternally in embryonic cells, or maybe
even an interplay of both.


[PAGE 5] (11) Why can LR phenotypes be
dissociated from essential house-
keeping functions for numerous
pathways? Several pathways that
have been implicated in asymmetry
also have important and profound
roles in basic cell physiology. These
include the V-ATPase H+ pump (Ad-
ams et al., 2006), which acidifies vacu-
oles, gap junctions (Levin and Mer-
cola, 1998a; Chuang et al., 2007),
which regulate numerous aspects of
small metabolites between cells, tight
junctions (Brizuela et al., 2001; Eckert
et al., 2005; Vanhoven et al., 2006),
which provide epithelial integrity, K+
channels (Levin et al., 2002), that reg-
ulate transmembrane potential, mi-
crotubules, and actin filaments (Thi-
tamadee et al., 2002; Abe et al., 2004;
Qiu et al., 2005; Adams et al., 2006;
Aw et al., 2008), which are required
for cell division and intracellular
transport, and Ca++ signaling
(McGrath et al., 2003; Raya et al.,
2004), which regulates numerous sec-
ond-messenger pathways. Despite the
pleiotropic nature of these mecha-
nisms, it has proven possible to ana-
lyze clean LR asymmetry phenotypes
after loss-of-function perturbations of
key members of these pathways. A
priori, this is highly unexpected;
blocking all K+ channels with barium
chloride or disrupting actin organiza-
tion with Latrunculin would be ex-
pected to result in massive defects or
toxicity, not the observed heterotaxia
with normal dorsoanterior develop-
