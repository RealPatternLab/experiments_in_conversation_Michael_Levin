      "text": "Many neurodevelopmental genetic disorders, such as Rett syndrome, are caused by a single gene mutation but trigger changes in expression and regulation of numerous other genes, impacting multiple organ systems beyond the CNS, making it challenging to develop broadly effective treatments. This challenge is compounded by the lack of sufficiently broad and biologically relevant drug screens and the complexity of identifying clinically relevant targets responsible for diverse phenotypes. This study combined human gene regulatory network-based computational drug prediction with in vivo screening in a population-level diversity, CRISPR-edited, Xenopus laevis tadpole model of Rett syndrome for target-agnostic drug discovery, leading to the identification of vorinostat. Vorinostat improved both CNS and non-CNS abnormalities in a pre-clinical mouse model, demonstrating pre-clinical efficacy across multiple organ systems when dosed after symptom onset. Network analysis revealed a putative therapeutic mechanism involving acetylation metabolism and microtubule post-translational modifications. While considered an HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat restored protein acetylation in both hypo- and hyperacetylated tissues, suggesting non-HDAC-mediated mechanisms supported by proteomic analysis.",

      "text": "Rett Syndrome (Rett) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting multiple organs, primarily caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene, a transcriptional repressor and activator. Cellular heterogeneity, with mixed wild-type and mutant cells, leads to widespread gene misregulation. While research focuses on CNS symptoms like neuromotor and cognitive impairments, patients also experience respiratory dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues, inflammation, and metabolic disruptions, contributing significantly to morbidity.  Although gene therapy is theoretically possible, challenges remain regarding delivery and dosage compensation.  Current pharmaceutical treatments like trofinetide and sarizotan have shown limited efficacy, primarily targeting CNS symptoms.

      "text": "Thermal proteome profiling revealed that vorinostat and ivermectin bind to proteins involved in acetylation metabolism, suggesting a mechanism involving restoration of acetyl-CoA metabolism and post-translational acetylation. Analysis of tadpole tissues showed bidirectional shifts in α-tubulin acetylation depending on tissue type. α-tubulin was hypoacetylated in brain regions and hyperacetylated in the GI tract and olfactory multiciliated cells of Rett tadpoles. Vorinostat restored cilia length and orientation in multiciliated cells and rescued ciliary function, as measured by microbead clearance.  Increased isolectin B4-positive (ib4+) cells in the GI tract of Rett tadpoles, indicative of inflammation, was also reversed by vorinostat.",

      "text": "Vorinostat's efficacy was evaluated in a MeCP2-/Y mouse model.  Both vorinostat and trofinetide improved disease-related parameters, including diarrhea and motor function, when administered intraperitoneally starting at p31. Vorinostat showed better neurological function improvement in the elevated plus maze. Both drugs enhanced spatial novelty Y-maze performance and improved diarrhea scores.  Microglia in MeCP2-/Y mice exhibited stunted morphology, indicative of inflammation, which was restored by vorinostat.  Serum inflammatory markers were also reduced by vorinostat. Oral vorinostat administered after symptom onset prevented worsening of symptoms, improved weight gain, and enhanced cognitive performance in EPM and Y mazes, while trofinetide was ineffective.  Vorinostat also improved mobility, gait, hindlimb clasping, diarrhea, and breathing.  Hyperacetylation of α-tubulin in lung bronchioles and disrupted α-tubulin acetylation in femoral muscle were rescued by vorinostat.  In the colon, vorinostat reversed vacuolization and neutrophil infiltrate and normalized α-tubulin acetylation, while trofinetide had mixed effects.",

      "text": "This study demonstrates the value of combining computational network analysis with CRISPR-generated in vivo disease models for drug discovery. The Xenopus tadpole model effectively captured Rett syndrome heterogeneity and provided results that translated well to a mouse model. The target-agnostic computational approach, nemoCAD, enabled the discovery of novel mechanisms and drugs with broad efficacy across multiple organs. Vorinostat's ability to normalize both hypo- and hyperacetylated tubulin suggests a complex mechanism beyond HDAC inhibition.  Importantly, vorinostat showed efficacy in the mouse model even after symptom onset, offering a more clinically relevant pre-clinical benchmark. This platform offers the potential for developing single small molecule therapeutics addressing multiple disease pathways and enables the discovery of hidden therapeutic mechanisms for new drug development.",
