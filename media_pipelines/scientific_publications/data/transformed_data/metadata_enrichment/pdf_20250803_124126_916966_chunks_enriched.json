      "text": "Though neuroscientists have historically relied upon measurement of established nervous systems, contemporary advances in bioengineering have made it possible to design and build artificial neural tissues with which to investigate normative and diseased states; however, their potential to display features of learning and memory remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate response patterns characteristic of habituation, a form of non-associative learning, in 3D bioengineered neural tissues exposed to repetitive injections of current to elicit evoked-potentials (EPs). A return of the evoked response following rest indicated learning was transient and partially reversible. Applying patterned current as massed or distributed pulse trains induced differential expression of immediate early genes (IEG) that are known to facilitate synaptic plasticity and participate in memory formation. Our findings represent the first demonstration of a learning response in a bioengineered neural tissue in vitro.",

      "text": "Learning, the process by which a system acquires or modifies information, is an intrinsically adaptive biological strategy. Once dedicated to an animal's memory, the utility of learned responses parallel those conferred to the species through natural selection by facilitating the avoidance of noxious events, the pursuit of rewards, and ultimately, self-propagation. Non-associative learning represents a rudimentary operation that has been observed ubiquitously in nature from primates to protozoa. It is operationally defined as any change to the parameters of a response upon repetitive stimulation. That is, when continually stimulated, most organisms learn to either suppress (habituate) or enhance (sensitize) their outputs contingent upon a history of inputs. Until recently, the study of learning was restricted to the observation and manipulation of naturally-derived organisms and their established nervous systems; however, recent advances in neural tissue engineering have made it possible to build minimal, synthetic tissue constructs with which to explore the structure-function degeneracy of cognitive processes such as learning and memory.",

As previously reported, our bioengineered tissue model is composed of a three-dimensional (3D) silk-based scaffold seeded with embryonic rat neurons and glia. Unlike classical cortical histoarchitecture which reflects a predictable laminar morphology, the anatomy of our neural tissue constructs can be customized according to desired specifications. Without an imposed design, neurons self-assemble into dense, haphazard networks within the scaffolds. The tissues display robust electrophysiological activity and secrete expected biochemical factors; however, it remains unclear whether they are capable of complex functional responses.

Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 µM) was used to block voltage-gated sodium channels and suppress action potential generation associated with the applied current.

In some cases, spike detection was not achieved, and individual stimulations were excluded from the analysis – therefore some trials involved less than 30 stimulation events. To reduce trial-to-trial variability, only the first 15 EPs were analyzed. Because a plateau was achieved after < 5 stimulations, 15 EPs were more than sufficient. Once extracted, the TTX-blocked signals were used to generate an averaged waveform characteristic of the trial-specific current application and subtracted from the stimulation phases to reveal EPs.

These data were then re-scaled from 0 to 1 using the min-max normalization method to eliminate negative z-score values while preserving their distribution (Figure S1E, F). To quantify habituation, the average re-scaled z-score associated with the last 3 stimulations was divided by the average re-scaled z-score associated with the first 2 stimulations to generate a habituation quotient (HQ) where a value of 1 represented non-habituation.

The 2 Hz condition displayed reduced HQ values relative to other conditions, indicative of habituation (Figure 3A). We then hypothesized that either the initial magnitude of the response or the net decrement was driving the observed difference due to frequency. An ANOVA identified an effect of frequency on the first 2 EPs [F(2,98)=4.60, p=0.01] but not for the last 3 EPs (p>0.05). The 2 Hz condition was associated with greater normalized peaks among the first 2 EPs relative to other frequency conditions (p<0.005). These results suggested the magnitude of the initial EPs relative to subsequent EPs was affected by frequency where more frequent stimuli generated a more extreme initial response relative to later responses.",

When individual cells were subjected to a similar protocol (patch-clamp), we not only elicited a decrement in evoked action potentials, but we demonstrated that the response recovered after a 20 sec rest period (Figure S1A) To test for recovery in the 3D bioengineered samples, we selected all trials that displayed an extreme initial normalized EP (z > 2) indicative of the classic habituation curve (n=21). Of this subset, there were n=5, n=12, and n=4 trials associated with the 2 Hz, 1 Hz, and 0.5 Hz conditions respectively. Examined together, a partial recovery was evident with a paired t-test revealing a significantly increased normalized EP following the rest period t(20)=4.20, p<0.001 (Figure 3B). The impact of frequency became apparent when each group was examined in isolation (Figure 3C). The 0.5 Hz condition displayed a significantly increased EP following the rest period (p<0.005) with a full recovery relative to the first EP of the habituation phase (p>0.05). The 1 Hz condition displayed a similar increase (p<0.005) with a partial recovery relative to the first EP of the habituation phase (p<0.05). The 2 Hz condition, however, did not display any indication of spontaneous recovery. Considered together, these data indicated that learning was reversible in the bioengineered tissues.",

      "text": "As has been known for over a century, the efficiency and stability of learned responses in behaving organisms are contingent upon the spatiotemporal distribution of stimulation events. That is, animals learn differently if engagement with stimuli are experienced continuously (i.e., massed) or spread over several discrete periods (i.e., distributed). Similarly, but distinct from the applied pattern presented here, the quintessential memory-encoding process long-term potentiation (LTP) is also quite sensitive to the distribution of stimulation events. Therefore, we asked whether the same principles would apply to our artificial neural constructs. To assess synaptic plasticity, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 3D tissue constructs revealed marked differences in gene expression as a function of the training pattern (Figure 4A,B). Distributed (D) training generated increased expression of genes that are known to govern synaptic plasticity relative to its equivalent control condition (CD). There were no significant differences between massed training (M) and equivalent controls (CM). Several genes associated with the Early Growth Response (EGR) family of transcriptional factors emerged as significantly upregulated in tissues exposed to distributed training relative to other groups. We also examined several genes that suppress memory and learning (e.g., Ppp1ca) or those that were non-specific (e.g., Ppp1cc, Ppp3ca, Mapk1); however, no significant differences were observed between tissues exposed to distributed training and equivalent controls (Figure S2). These data suggested that bioengineered tissues can be induced to express the early molecular markers of memory formation.",

Some results were unexpected, including displays of variable EPs following the initial decrement (Figure 2E) and the absence of spontaneous recovery associated with the 2Hz condition (Figure 3C). The former result may indicate the heterogeneity of the tissues or variable placement of the electrodes relative to embedded networks. With regard to spontaneous recovery, the trend suggests that as frequency decreased, recovery was more likely (Figure 3C); however, the underlying mechanism is not apparent from the data.

The EGR transcriptional factors (Figure 4C) are known to underly synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Like other IEGs, EGR family members are rapidly and transiently expressed in response to neuronal activation. LTP, electroconvulsive shock, and learning paradigms are known to increase Egr family expression. The pulsed injections of current that we used to stimulate the bioengineered neural tissues are, however, distinct from those used in classic LTP, as explained previously. As expected the distributed current pattern successfully induced synaptic plasticity. The spontaneous recovery data presented in Figure 3B,C and the gene expression data indicate that cells did not die when injected with current; rather, responses were dependent upon the parameters of the applied stimuli. Egrl and Egr3 are involved in the maintenance of LTP as well as long- and short-term memory respectively, whereas Egr2 is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Egr4, however, does not have any known role in memory, though it may be linked to intelligence. While these results are interesting and supportive of the main hypothesis, a detailed exploration of mechanisms underlying the expressed response to distributed training was beyond the scope of the present work.",
