      "text": "This paper introduces a new conceptual and computational framework for damage detection and regeneration in multicellular structures, aiming to achieve complete and accurate regeneration from any damage. The model is demonstrated on an artificial organism with head, body, and tail structures, each composed of a stem cell and differentiated cells. Tissues are represented as Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANNs) with local interactions, while stem cells function as self-repair networks with long-range interactions. An \"Information Field\" concept stores minimal pattern information for access by stem cells in extreme damage scenarios. Stem cells monitor tissue integrity via entropy, triggering damage detection and repair upon violation. The model regenerates at two levels: tissue regeneration with intact stem cells, and stem cell network restoration with missing tissues and stem cells. This framework offers a new perspective on regeneration, potentially benefiting regenerative medicine and bio-robot development.",
