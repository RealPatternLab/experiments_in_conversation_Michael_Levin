      "text": "Biased left-right asymmetry is a fascinating and medically important phenomenon. We provide molecular genetic and physiological characterization of a novel, conserved, early, biophysical event that is crucial for correct asymmetry: H+ flux. A pharmacological screen implicated the H+-pump H+-V-ATPase in Xenopus asymmetry, where it acts upstream of early asymmetric markers. Immunohistochemistry revealed an actin-dependent asymmetry of H+-V-ATPase subunits during the first three cleavages. H+-flux across plasma membranes is also asymmetric at the four- and eight-cell stages, and this asymmetry requires H+-V-ATPase activity. Abolishing the asymmetry in H+ flux, using a dominant-negative subunit of the H+-V-ATPase or an ectopic H+ pump, randomized embryonic situs without causing any other defects.",

      "text": "To understand the mechanism of action of H+-V-ATPase, we isolated its two physiological functions, cytoplasmic pH and membrane voltage (Vmem) regulation. Varying either pH or Vmem, independently of direct manipulation of H+-V-ATPase, caused disruptions of normal asymmetry, suggesting roles for both functions. V-ATPase inhibition also abolished the normal early localization of serotonin, functionally linking these two early asymmetry pathways. The involvement of H+-V-ATPase in asymmetry is conserved to chick and zebrafish. Inhibition of the H+-V-ATPase induces heterotaxia in both species; in chick, H+-V-ATPase activity is upstream of Shh; in fish, it is upstream of Kupffer's vesicle and Spaw expression. Our data implicate H+-V-ATPase activity in patterning the LR axis of vertebrates and reveal mechanisms upstream and downstream of its activity. We propose a pH- and Vmem-dependent model of the early physiology of LR patterning.",

Although the genetic cascades of secreted signals that occur on only one side of the embryo are being elucidated, upstream mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent findings shed light on the events which function upstream of asymmetric transcription, and it is now known that ion flux is involved in determining the laterality of several vertebrates and invertebrates. To gain molecular insight into endogenous ion flows that control asymmetry, we performed a loss-of-function drug screen, implicating the H+/K+-ATPase.

      "text": "Interestingly, besides the ‘housekeeping’ functions of the H+-V-ATPase and other electrogenic proteins, their activity has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. One important example of morphogenesis relying upon precisely orchestrated cell behavior is the generation of consistent left-right asymmetry, and a number of biophysical mechanisms based on bioelectricity and fluid movement have been implicated. Moreover, the conservation of early LR mechanisms is highly controversial. Although ion flux is crucial in early frog and chick embryos, ciliary motion has been implicated in rodents and zebrafish. To understand how ion fluxes participate in asymmetry, it is necessary to characterize the endogenous behavior of the relevant pumps in embryos and to place their function in the context of known LR patterning mechanisms. Here, we explore the properties of H+-V-ATPase function in several vertebrate embryos. Through endogenous localization of the H+-V-ATPase and gain- and loss-of-function experiments in chick, frog and zebrafish, we identify the H+-V-ATPase as a novel, conserved, obligate component of LR patterning upstream of asymmetric gene expression.",

In early embryos, most proteins are symmetrically localized with respect to the LR axis (Fig. 3A,B). Immunohistochemistry revealed that at the two-cell stage, H+-V-ATPase subunits (Fig. 3D) exhibited ‘fingers’ extending up from a pool in the vegetal cytoplasm into the animal half. Such patterns are specific to a number of LR-relevant proteins but are not a general feature of all protein localization in the early frog embryo (Fig. 3A,B). In sections perpendicular to the AV axis at the two-cell stage, one cell was often more heavily stained (>80% of the embryos examined, Fig. 3E) (see Fig. S1I-K in the supplementary material), exhibiting both a cytoplasmic pool and localization at the cell cortex. At the four-cell stage, staining was still asymmetrical, and was on the right side in embryos that could be oriented by the cleavage furrows and pigmentation (Fig. 3F, see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). Consistent with the proposed role of the H+-V-ATPase in LR asymmetry, these electrogenic protein subunits are novel markers of LR asymmetry as early as the first two cleavages in Xenopus.",

In measurements on 15 embryos made between the four-cell stage and stage 6, the average proton efflux from the middle of the right ventral quadrant was 4.1±0.48 pmole cm−2s−1 and from the left ventral quadrant was 1.9±0.29 pmole cm−2s−1.

Although pH 7-11 had no effect on asymmetry, pH 5-6 caused a low level of LR patterning defects (6%, P=0.003), and pH 4 caused a significant level of heterotaxia (19%, P<0.001). This is consistent with inhibition of the activity of H+-extruding pumps by high external proton concentrations.

This confirms the importance of pH for LR asymmetry, and, similar to the PMA1.2 data, indicates that the relevant H+ flux occurs at the cell membrane, not in vesicles. Interestingly, NHE3 was active in causing heterotaxia only when injected in the vegetal hemisphere and when injected within 60 minutes of fertilization; later injections had no effect. Assuming that NHE3 mRNA is translated ~1.5 hours after injection (based on detection of β-gal/GFP translation), the temporal window during which NHE3 can cause heterotaxia ends by 2.0 to 2.5 hours post-fertilization at 18°C. Consistent with expression data, the asymmetric membrane voltages at 16-cell stage, and the lack of effect on asymmetry of late YCHE78 injection or DNA injection, we conclude that the LR-relevant gradients in cell membrane H+ flux occur during the first cleavages, and that normal asymmetric pH at the cell membrane is crucial for LR patterning.",
