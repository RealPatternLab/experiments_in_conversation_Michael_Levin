      "text": "Niche construction is a concept in evolutionary theory that emphasizes the active role organisms play in modifying their environments, influencing both their own evolution and sometimes that of other species. The traditional view of organisms as passive entities adapting to environmental pressures is challenged by this perspective as it highlights the active role of species in shaping their environment and selection pressures. By altering their ecological niches, organisms not only respond to selection forces but also create new ones, they are active engineers of their environment, and doing so they transform their evolutionary landscape. The origins of niche construction theory can be traced back to John Odling-Smee, who first introduced the term in the late 1980's [1]. This idea came from earlier critiques of adaptationism, particularly those of Richard Lewontin, who argued that organisms do not simply adapt to their environments but actively participate in transforming the selective forces that constrained them in their environment [2]. This theory was further developed and refined in *Niche Construction: The Neglected Process in Evolution* [3], which established the theoretical framework for understanding niche construction as an evolutionary process.",

      "text": "Examples of niche construction are abundant in nature. Beavers construct dams that transform streams into ponds, altering ecosystems in ways that affect not only their survival but also the one of numerous other species [4-6]. Human beings are perhaps the most prolific niche constructors, strongly affecting their environment with the creation of cities, industry, the world wide web, etc. that will persist long after the lifetime of their creators. In this way, they affect their evolution and the ones of numerous other species in relation with them [7]. Thus, the concept of niche construction is quite general and has been extended to host-parasite dynamics, animal and human behavior, technological invention, and social dynamics [8-20]. A key concept of niche construction theory is ecological inheritance. Unlike genetic inheritance, which transmits biological information directly through DNA, ecological inheritance involves the transmission of modified environments across generations. Beaver dams persist long after the original builders have died, influencing selection pressures on subsequent generations [3]. Human civilizations can last centuries. This form of inheritance has significant implications for understanding evolutionary dynamics, as it introduces epigenetic pathways through which evolutionary change can occur.",

      "text": "Niche construction provides a broader framework for understanding feedback mechanisms in evolution. Environmental changes induced by organisms often lead to selective feedback, shaping the traits of both the constructors and other species within the ecosystem. This feedback loop can accelerate adaptation and drive co-evolutionary processes. For instance, the cultivation of starchy crops by early humans not only transformed their environment but also created selection pressures that led to the evolution of multiple copies of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1), which facilitates starch digestion [21]. Genes have been described as niche constructors themselves, including transposable elements, genes that affect methylation patterns and chromatin remodeling mechanisms, and other aspects of the effects of genetic elements on the genome and other genes [22-29]. Although niche construction shares similarities with Richard Dawkins' concept of the extended phenotype [30], it is broader in scope. The extended phenotype focuses on adaptive traits expressed outside the organism's body, such as spider webs or bird nests whose genes underlie a constructing trait [31]. In contrast, niche construction encompasses a wide range of environmental modifications, including modified selection as both an additional component of inheritance that is not only genetic (‘ecological inheritance'), and an influence on evolutionary dynamics, and persists long after the lifetime of the organism [3]. The implications of niche construction extend beyond biology, offering new perspectives in fields such as anthropology, ecology, and conservation science. Its integration into the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis has further solidified its importance, providing a framework that unites ecological and evolutionary processes [32].",

      "text": "A number of recent efforts have sought to identify scale-free, substrate-independent dynamics across biology [33-39], including the identification of active agents above the level of genes [40-42]. Thus, it is tempting to ask what insights the concept of niche construction can bring, if it is mapped onto novel spatio-temporal scales and novel substrates at different levels of biological organization. In particular, the niche construction paradigm requires one to specify, in any complex system, what one takes to be the agent, and what is considered to be the “environment” that the agent modifies via its activities. Making this mapping (and the border between an agent and its world) explicit is a valuable feature because it facilitates testing diverse ways to map the agent/environment, and indeed the machine/data metaphor of computational science, onto elements of living, engineered, and social systems. Here, we argue that the deep insights of classical niche construction research can provide new ways to look at disciplines ranging from developmental biology to cognitive science and AI. In particular, being willing to blur the lines between classical boundaries of “organism” and “niche\\\" enables novel research programs.",
