CFAs in ATS manifest as a variety of facial features including broad forehead and nose, wide-set eyes, low-set ears, small lower jaw, and digit abnormalities.  While the link between KCNJ2 mutations and cardiac/paralysis symptoms is understood, the cause of CFAs remained unknown.  Alcohol binding to Kir2.1 has also been proposed as a mechanism for CFAs in fetal alcohol syndrome.
