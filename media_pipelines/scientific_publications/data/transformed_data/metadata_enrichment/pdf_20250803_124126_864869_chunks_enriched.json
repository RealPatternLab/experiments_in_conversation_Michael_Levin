      "text": "Recent work has highlighted the importance of bioelectric signals, alongside biochemical signals, in controlling morphogenesis during embryonic development. These bioelectric signals, involving ion fluxes and voltage gradients, influence various cellular behaviors such as galvanotaxis, wound healing, limb development, and mitotic control. A key example of bioelectric control in pattern formation is left-right (LR) patterning, where physiological asymmetries in voltage, pH, and intracellular molecule movement play a crucial role in establishing the consistent placement of organs like the heart and viscera.",

      "text": "Previous research identified three key transporters involved in LR asymmetry in Xenopus: H+/K+-ATPase, V-ATPase, and a K+ inward rectifier. These transporters, present as maternal proteins, are asymmetrically localized during early cleavages, leading to measurable asymmetries in H+ efflux and membrane voltage. Experimental equalization of these asymmetries randomizes organ situs without affecting dorso-anterior development. While quantitative models are being developed to understand the link between asymmetric channel localization, voltage gradients, morphogen movement, and gene expression, the mechanism by which the electroneutral H+/K+-ATPase generates a voltage difference remains unclear.",

KCNQ1, when co-assembled with its accessory subunit KCNE1, forms the Iks channel. KCNE1 modifies KCNQ1's biophysical properties, influencing voltage dependence, activation kinetics, inactivation, and conductance. KCNQ1 plays vital roles in cardiac function, hearing, and gastric acid secretion, where it cooperates with H+/K+-ATPase for luminal K+ recycling. This cooperative relationship between H+/K+-ATPase and KCNQ1 in mammalian tissues suggests a similar mechanism in embryonic LR asymmetry, where KCNQ1 could facilitate K+ exit, enabling H+/K+-ATPase to alter membrane voltage.",
