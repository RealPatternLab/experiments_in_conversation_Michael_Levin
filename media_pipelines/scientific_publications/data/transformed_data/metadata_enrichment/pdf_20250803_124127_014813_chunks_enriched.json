These scalar products encode the dynamics of TQFTs, fulfilling curvature and gauge invariance constraints.  BF theories are a class of TQFTs used to model particle physics, gravity, condensed matter, and quantum information. They are defined on a principal bundle with a connection and a frame-field.  The equations of motion impose flatness of the connection and gauge invariance. Quantum states are represented by cylindrical functionals supported on graphs with holonomies and intertwiner operators.  For SU(2), spin-networks form a basis of the kinematical Hilbert space.",

Matrix elements of this scalar product give rise to an n-tensor. Out-of-equilibrium dynamics is considered by introducing a heat-flow evolution of fields with respect to thermal time. Langevin equations with stochastic noise describe relaxation towards equilibrium.  Ricci flow is a prototype of geometric heat-flow, where the drift terms are the Einstein equations.  The stochastic Ricci flow (SRF) describes a generic gravitational system with matter fields. Equilibration trajectories correspond to a renormalization group (RG) flow, with thermal time as the scale parameter. For BF theories, the geometric RG flow is the TQFT equivalent of the gravitational Ricci flow.",

TNs can also be used for weight compression in artificial neural networks (ANNs).  TNs are well-suited for representing quantum many-body states. The ML approach involves lifting data to higher spaces, applying a linear classifier in a non-linear space, and compressing weights using TNs.  The decision function is the overlap of the weight tensor with the feature map tensor.  Regularization and optimization are achieved through low-order tensors, and weight compression is performed using Matrix Product States (MPS).
