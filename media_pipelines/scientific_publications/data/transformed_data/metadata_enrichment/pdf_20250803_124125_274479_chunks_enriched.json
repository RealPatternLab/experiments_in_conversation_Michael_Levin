      "text": "Pamela Lyon argues that cognition is a biological adaptation for coping with environmental complexity.  Her biogenic framework anchors cognition in biology.  Lyon's ten biogenic principles summarize the foundations of cognitive biology: continuity, control, interaction, normativity, memory, selectivity, valence, anticipation, reduction of randomness, and interdependence.  These principles highlight the importance of studying simple model systems to understand the basis of cognition and then expanding to more complex examples.  To find minimal cognitive processes, we must consider the production and processing of communication signals for group behavior and interconnections between individual units (cells).",

His project aimed to explain the mind through complexity and cybernetic organization.  Bateson's six criteria for cognitive (mental) processes are: 1) a mind is a set of interacting parts, 2) interaction is triggered by difference, 3) the mental process requires collateral energy, 4) it requires circular processes of determination, 5) effects of difference are transformations of preceding events, and 6) these transformations reveal a hierarchy of logical prototypes. These criteria are linked to the cognitive processes described by Humberto Maturana.",
