      "text": "The chirality of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is controlled by a maternally expressed locus, with the D allele determining a clockwise shell twist. During development, micromeres emerge and twist clockwise in dextral embryos, while sinistral embryos show a later counterclockwise twist. This difference is preceded by chiral spindle orientation in dextral embryos and radial positioning in sinistral embryos. A 0.4 Mb region containing the chirality locus was identified, and a BAC clone walk and genome sequencing were used to pinpoint the gene. Six genes were linked to D, including a pair of duplicated diaphanous-related formin genes (Ldia1 and Ldia2). A frameshift mutation in Ldia2 was found in sinistral snails, and Ldia2 expression was significantly different based on genotype, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay of mutated transcripts. The tandem duplication may explain the non-lethality of the Ldia2 mutation, with Ldia1 and Ldia2 potentially having overlapping roles but also specialized functions, as evidenced by their differential enrichment in embryos versus somatic tissues.",

The Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666 had a less pronounced effect, suggesting formin-mediated actin assembly is crucial for chiral cleavage orientation.

The dia duplication, present in L. trunculata, predates its divergence from L. stagnalis, while single-copy dia genes in sinistral snails are more similar to Ldia1. This suggests Ldia2 is the derived paralog with a specialized embryonic function, whose loss leads to sinistrality. Phylogenetic analysis suggests either a single sinistral origin with a reversion to dextrality in Lymnaeidae or two separate sinistral origins. The former is consistent with the dia duplication enabling dextrality in Lymnaeidae.  In other chirally variable snails like Euhadra and Partula, chirality wasn't associated with single-copy dia variation, suggesting additional components in the LR asymmetry pathway.",

Treatment during neurula stages, when ciliary flow is present, showed strong effects for both inhibitors.  Overexpression of mouse dia1 mRNA in frog embryos also resulted in heterotaxia, regardless of injection timing or location.
