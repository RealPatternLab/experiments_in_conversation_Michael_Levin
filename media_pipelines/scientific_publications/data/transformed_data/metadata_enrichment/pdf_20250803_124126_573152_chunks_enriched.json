Neuronal depolarization and hyperpolarization are essential for our neuromuscular physiological and pathological functions. Bioelectricity is being recognized as an ancient, intrinsic, fundamental property of all living cells, and it is not limited to the neuromuscular system. Instead, emerging evidence supports a view of bioelectricity as an instructional signaling cue for fundamental cellular physiology, embryonic development, regeneration, and human diseases, including cancers. Here, we highlight the current understanding of bioelectricity and share our views on the challenges and perspectives. </jats:p>",
