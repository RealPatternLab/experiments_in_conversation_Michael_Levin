      "text": "Optogenetics, using light to regulate proteins, has revolutionized excitable cell study and holds therapeutic promise for controlling action potentials. However, its application to resting potential control in developing or regenerating cells in vivo remains unexplored. This is crucial because abnormal ion currents in non-excitable cells contribute to birth defects and cancer.  Transmembrane resting potential changes initiate Xenopus tadpole tail regeneration, including spinal cord regrowth, in tails inhibited by H⁺-V-ATPase pump inactivity.  Current methods lack non-invasive bioelectric parameter control and defined time point abrogation. This study demonstrates light-activated H⁺-pump reversal of age-dependent vertebrate regeneration loss by hyperpolarizing transmembrane potentials. Light-dependent, Archaerhodopsin-based H⁺-flux hyperpolarized cells in vivo, rescuing Xenopus embryos from craniofacial and patterning abnormalities caused by endogenous H⁺-flux blockade.  Light stimulation of Arch for 2 days post-amputation restored inhibited tail regenerative capacity, inducing cell proliferation, tissue innervation, and *notch1* and *msx1* upregulation, essential regenerative pathway genes. Electroneutral pH change via sodium proton exchanger NHE3 did not rescue regeneration, implicating Arch's hyperpolarizing activity. Hyperpolarization is required only during the first 48 hours post-injury, and spinal cord expression is unnecessary.  This study shows that complex bioelectric events altering body patterning can be elicited by temporal modulation of a single ion current using optogenetic reagents, highlighting its potential for preventive, therapeutic, and regenerative medicine.",

      "text": "Light-activated ion transport proteins have revolutionized action potential control in nerve and muscle cells, but their application to developing or regenerating systems and disease events remains unknown. Endogenous bioelectrical signals regulate cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, migration, and morphology, making in vivo resting potential manipulation a promising biomedical application. Optogenetics offers spatio-temporal control, particularly relevant to regenerative medicine, where bioelectric signals initiate complex organ and appendage regeneration. The Xenopus tadpole tail, comprising spinal cord, notochord, muscle, nerves, vasculature, and skin, is a powerful regeneration model. Tail amputation depolarizes the stump, and a hyperpolarizing signal, initiated by H⁺-V-ATPase expression and H⁺-efflux at 6 hpa, is required for regeneration. Inhibiting H⁺-V-ATPase blocks regeneration.  Xenopus tadpoles exhibit age-dependent regenerative changes, with endogenous H⁺-efflux absence and stump depolarization inhibiting regeneration during the refractory period. This study explores minimally invasive bioelectric state control and temporal boundaries of membrane voltage in regenerative pathways using light-gated ion pumps.  Archaerhodopsin (Arch), a light-activated hyperpolarizing H⁺-pump, was used to manipulate H⁺-flux-dependent regeneration initiation.  The study demonstrates light-dependent Arch hyperpolarization in larval Xenopus tissues, functionally replacing the endogenous V-type proton pump. Light-activated Arch rescues developmental and regenerative defects caused by endogenous or experimental H⁺-efflux inhibition, acting through Notch and MSX1.  48 hours of light-activation post-injury is sufficient for complete neuromuscular appendage regeneration at non-regenerative ages.",
