Using whole-organism screening of metabolism, mobility, and development in Xenopus, we identified an existing drug, SNC80, that rapidly and reversibly slows biochemical and metabolic activities while preserving cell and tissue viability. Although SNC80 was developed as a delta opioid receptor activator, we discovered that its ability to slow metabolism is independent of its opioid modulating activity as a novel SNC80 analog (WB3) with almost 1000 times less delta opioid receptor binding activity is equally active. Metabolic suppression was also achieved using SNC80 in microfluidic human organs-on-chips, as well as in explanted whole porcine hearts and limbs, demonstrating the cross-species relevance of this approach and potential clinical relevance for surgical transplantation. Pharmacological induction of physiological slowing in combination with organ perfusion transport systems may offer a new therapeutic approach for tissue and organ preservation for transplantation, trauma management, and enhancing patient survival in remote and low-resource locations.",

The rapid and reversible slowing of metabolic and other physiological processes, here referred to as 'biostasis', can improve the survival of cells and organs for transplantation. This is currently accomplished clinically by lowering temperature and static cold storage is the standard of care for organ and tissue preservation; however, its long-term use can cause damage to the integrity of the graft (Vela et al., 2020; Petrenko et al., 2019; Guibert et al., 2011). Hypothermia has also been used to induce a state of biostasis clinically using ex vivo machine perfusion technologies, e.g., during cardiac transplant surgery. Combination of protective agents with perfusion and/or partial freezing approaches have extended preservation times in rat livers and whole pigs (Andrijevic et al., 2022; Tessier et al., 2022), and neural modulation approaches have been successful at demonstrating central control of body temperature and general metabolic state (Hrvatin et al., 2020; Takahashi et al., 2020). However, both mechanical cooling and neural stimulation approaches are challenging to implement in a trauma triage or resource-limited situations, which would be better addressed by pharmaceutical interventions.",

      "text": "Several molecular strategies have been proposed to achieve metabolic suppression for organ preservation, including modulating H2S, AMPK, opioid receptors, microRNAs, HO-1, and Nrf2 (Dou et al., 2022). H2S exposure has been reported to induce a hypometabolic state (reduced metabolism and body temperature) in a rodent model, although this was later found to be mediated in part by a low baseline laboratory temperature (Blackstone et al., 1979). The synthetic opioid peptide DADLE can also induce hypometabolism and improve organ preservation via a delta opioid receptor (DOR) mechanism, but with varied results (Beal et al., 2019; Ratigan and McKay, 2016). Compounds that directly impact glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration also have been considered for modulating organ metabolism, but many are acutely toxic and not reversible, fail to protect tissues from ischemic injury, or lack drug-like properties. Specifically, reduced functionality of the mitochondrial electron transport chain system without the endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules released by hibernators can result in the release of reactive oxygen species and cause tissue damage (Dou et al., 2022).",

      "text": "Despite these efforts, there remains a large unmet need for improved tissue and organ preservation approaches across multiple application areas. Thus, in the present study, we set out to identify small molecules that could slow metabolism and mimic states normally induced by hypothermia, hibernation, or torpor, which could be used for preservation of living cells, tissues, and organs ex vivo, and potentially in vivo as well. Specifically, we required this biostasis approach to be rapidly inducible (<1 hr) and safely reversible, with major tissue functions returning to control levels within 24 hr. Through survey of the literature, we identified drugs with unintended side effects, such as lowering body temperature, which suggested they might have broad effects on metabolism. During early compound screening, we evaluated known cellular respiration inhibitors (such as rotenone, FCCP, oligomycin A, and Ru360) and torpor inducers from the literature (such as DADLE, JS-K, AMP, sodium sulfide nonahydrate, and BW373u86). Compounds involved in activating the DOR pathway were of particular interest based on prior work suggesting that DOR activation extends the hypothermic preservation time of organs, including the heart (Schultz et al., 1997). Among these drugs was SNC80, a small molecule drug originally developed as a nonaddictive pain reliever that acts independently of the mu-opioid pathway (Rawls et al., 2005). This drug caught our attention because it has been shown to induce hypothermia and protect against the effects of spinal cord ischemia in rodents (Rawls et al., 2005; Horiuchi et al., 2004), however, further study was required to understand if these observations were related to biostatic effects. To explore whether SNC80 had potential to broadly slow tissue metabolism and physiology, we administered the drug to Xenopus laevis embryos and tadpoles, which we and others have previously shown to be useful models for drug screening due to their small size, extrauterine development, and skin permeability to small molecules (Sperry et al., 2022; Novak et al., 2022; Schmitt et al., 2014; Sullivan and Levin, 2018). The Xenopus tadpoles were dosed at higher levels than dictated by SNC80's defined IC50 value, with the goal of exploring the effects of SNC80 outside its known pain relief properties and accentuating the drug's 'off-target' effects, including hypometabolism.",

Behavioral assessment in mobile tadpoles showed that 100 µM SNC80 slows movement relative to vehicle-treated counterparts, reducing activity by approximately 50% within 1 hr, which is rapidly reversible when the drug is removed (Figure 1a). SNC80 also suppressed the rate of oxygen consumption to one-third of baseline within 3 hr of treatment (Figure 1b) and had extreme suppressive, but fully reversible, effects on heart rate after only 1 hr of exposure (Figure 1c).

SNC80 was detected within 1 hr of treatment and it appeared in a punctate distribution in the gastro-intestinal tract, gill region, and skeletal muscle (Figure 2a and b), suggesting full-body delivery of the drug. Specifically, uptake observed in the muscle may be responsible for the slowed motion observed in Xenopus activity assays. Past lipidomic studies of hibernating mammals demonstrated the importance of lipid molecules for thermal adaptation during hibernation with significant alterations of lipidomic profiles being observed in liver, plasma, brain, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle during torpor as compared to the animal's active state (Giroud et al., 2019; Kolomiytseva, 2011). Similarly, MALDI-TOF MSI analysis revealed significantly higher levels of acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester in SNC80-treated groups in both skeletal muscle and brain, but not in cardiac tissue (Figure 2c). Increased levels of long chain acylcarnitine associated with enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation are observed during fasting as well as in hibernating brown bears (Soeters et al., 2009; Welinder et al., 2016), and cholesterol ester levels increase in hibernating ground squirrels (Otis et al., 2011). While the increased acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester levels in brain suggest a shift toward beta oxidation of fatty acids, they also have been implicated in other pathways including antioxidant activity and neurotransmission (Jones et al., 2010; Petrov et al., 2016).",

This was important since pre-clinical testing of SNC80 in rodents and non-human primates has demonstrated seizure side effects at higher doses, possibly due to SNC80's direct inhibition of forebrain GABAergic neurons via DOR activity (Chu Sin Chung et al., 2015). As SNC80 is a known DOR agonist (Rawls et al., 2005; Horiuchi et al., 2004), we next evaluated whether its effects could be mediated by delta opioids. However, when we tested the DOR antagonist, naltrindole (NTI), at double the concentration (200 µM) relative to SNC80 (100 µM), it did not block the hypometabolic effects of SNC80 (Figure 2d), suggesting that SNC80 modulates metabolism independent of DOR activation.",

Toward this end, we designed molecular entities void of the distal basic nitrogen (N-ally group within SNC80), which we hypothesized was a critical DOR pharmacophore. This effort led to the development of a novel morpholino compound, WB3 (Figure 3a and Supplemental Synthesis Description), which was synthesized and subsequently tested for DOR binding activity using a radioligand binding assay and nonlinear fitting for specific binding to calculate the Hill slope and IC50 value. A specific binding curve could not be fit for SNC80 due to its high affinity and therefore its IC50 is <4.6 nM, whereas WB3 exhibited an IC50 of 3470 nM (Figure 3b), suggesting almost 1000 times less DOR binding activity for WB3 compared to SNC80. Subsequently, we screened WB3 in the Xenopus swimming, oxygen consumption, and heart rate assays and found that the analog retains physiological slowing properties in vivo despite lacking delta opioid activity (Figure 3c, d, and e). In fact, we observed more potent and rapid effects on swimming with exposure to WB3 compared to SNC80, suggesting that the non-opioid properties of SNC80 may be primarily responsible for its observed physiological effects.",

      "text": "Based on these intriguing findings with Xenopus tadpoles, we set out to explore the potential clinical value of SNC80. Cardiac transplant is the gold standard for treating end-stage heart failure; however, it is hindered by donor shortage, limited cardiac graft preservation time, and lack of optimal organ preservation conditions. Currently, hearts are allocated to patients located within 4 hr of organ removal from the donor. Thus, to explore the potential utility of biostasis induction to lengthen the time between organ donation and recipient surgery through pharmacological induction of a hypometabolic state, we perfused surgically explanted whole porcine hearts with SNC80 using a portable, oxygenated perfusion preservation device (VP.S ENCORE) at subnormothermic temperatures (20–23°C). Prior work has demonstrated that the VP.S ENCORE enhances cardiac viability over standard of care-static cold storage and hearts perfused in this device for 4 hr demonstrate similar cardiac function to a healthy heart in both preclinical animal models and human deceased donor hearts (Veraza et al., 2023; Andrijauskaite et al., 2023). We investigated the application of a biostasis inducer for preservation of the heart during 6 hr of perfusion in the VP.S ENCORE device. Importantly, with SNC80 treatment, we observed a rapid decline in the heart's oxygen consumption to <50% of that observed in hearts exposed to the vehicle control, which was sustained over the 6 hr preservation period (Figure 4a). After preservation, hearts were removed from the VP.S ENCORE and placed in a Langendorff system for reperfusion and evaluation of oxygen consumption and cardiac contractility. This system assesses the left ventricular dP/dT without preload and afterload, thereby allowing the evaluation of the intrinsic contractility of the left ventricle (LV). After 30 min of reperfusion and before defibrillation, SNC80-treated hearts had a lower oxygen consumption level than vehicle-treated hearts (2.39 ± 1.23 versus 4.28 ± 2.48 mL/min/100 g, respectively, at the 30 min timepoint) (Figure 4b) that recovered to normal levels after defibrillation and with increases in temperature (2.49 ± 0.53 and 2.35 ± 0.31 mL/min/100 g, respectively, at 60 min post defibrillation) (Figure 4c). No evidence of substantial change in LV contractility or relaxation were detected in SNC80-exposed hearts, either before or after they were defibrillated and exposed to epinephrine (Figure 4d). Gene expression analysis of heart biopsy samples showed significant reduction of markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), hypoxia (Hif1a), and cell death (TP53, BCL2) in SNC80-treated hearts when compared to vehicle control hearts (Figure 4e), and no changes in the mitochondrial ATP synthase marker, ATP5MC3, were observed. Histopathological evaluation showed retention of normal muscle morphology (Figure 4f) without signs of tissue edema immediately after perfusion in the VP.S ENCORE. In some hearts treated with SNC80 greater waviness of muscle fibers was observed, possibly indicating a state of muscle contraction. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data revealed that both vehicle and SNC80-treated hearts exhibited irregular beating after perfusion and prior to defibrillation. After defibrillation by electric shock and epinephrine delivery, the P and QRS waveforms were visible in ECGs from three of four SNC80-treated hearts (Supplementary file 1), indicating that those hearts regained atrial and ventricular depolarization (internal charge of cardiac cells become less negative). The presence of the P and QRS waveforms suggests that the intrinsic atrial and ventricular muscle fiber contractility was preserved",

      "text": "To gain insight into the molecular basis of SNC80's hypometabolic and other physiological effects, we used thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to assess drug-protein binding and thereby identify previously unknown molecular targets of SNC80 that might be critical for its metabolism slowing activity. TPP of SNC80-treated Xenopus tissues revealed 19 direct and indirect binding targets (Table 1), including proteins involved in transmembrane transport, mitochondrion activity, and metabolic processes. Two potentially interesting binding targets of SNC80 are the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1, also known as SLC1A3) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1, also known as SLC8A1), both of which have been identified in cardiac tissue (Ralphe et al., 2004; Maiolino et al., 2017). In addition to their individual functions, mitochondrial ATP production has been previously reported to be stimulated through intermolecular interactions between EAATs and NCXs in neurons (Magi et al., 2013). If this complex is also present in cardiac tissue, inhibition of EAAT and NCX1 could reduce cellular ATP levels (Magi et al., 2019), and thereby play a role in slowing metabolism. Specifically, the blockade of Na+/Ca2+ exchange via interference with EAAT1-NCX1 interactions could prevent the influx of calcium into the mitochondria that is necessary for calcium-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases that fuel ATP synthesis (Magi et al., 2019). However, the mitochondrial variant of NCX1 (NCLX) was not included in the Xenopus protein library used for TPP analysis so could not be fully evaluated in this study. TPP also identified two additional SNC80-binding proteins located within the mitochondrion: TOMM40 and COX6C. TOMM40 is a translocase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria that has been implicated in tissue protective effects against late-onset Alzheimer disease (Chiba-Falek et al., 2018) and COX6C is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzing the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. In addition to interaction with mitochondrial proteins, we detected binding between SNC80 and enzymes involved in other metabolic processes, including alpha-L-fucosidase.",

      "text": "To explore whether this drug also induces a state of biostasis in cultured human cells, we monitored the effects of SNC80 on oxygen consumption in four different types of cultured human cells – human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and Huh7 liver epithelial cells – and analyzed multiple indicators of cellular metabolism using the Seahorse instrument. The latter allows to measure ECAR (extracellular acidification rate), typically serving as proxy for glycolysis activity and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a proxy for OXPHOS activity (since mitochondria are responsible for 70-90% of total oxygen consumption) (Yang et al., 2020). The Seahorse can also measure other mitochondrial respiration metrics such as ATP production. Treatment with SNC80 (100 µM) suppressed OCR and ATP production relative to control levels within 1.5 hr in epithelial cells derived from intestine and liver (Figure 5-figure supplement 1a) without detectable cytotoxicity (Figure 5-figure supplement 2a), indicating a decrease in cellular metabolism similar to Xenopus. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in creatine kinase activity in both epithelial cell types (Figure 5-figure supplement 2b), indicating a decrease in overall cell energy demand (Klepinina et al., 2021). However, cells can also compensate for decreased mitochondrial ATP production by activating other metabolic pathways (Mookerjee and Brand, 2015), indicated by an increase in ECAR. Typically, acidification is linked to lactic acid production due to glycolytic activity. Sometimes, however, it can be derived from cytosolic reductive carboxylation (CRC) liberating NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and H+. We used effluent glutamate levels as an indicator of the metabolic switch to glutamine utilization in CRC - a compensation typically used by cells with impaired mitochondrial respiration as a means for NADH recycling (Gaude et al., 2018). The Caco-2 cells exposed to SNC80 showed a dramatic increase in ECAR and glutamate production (Figure 5-figure supplement 2b), suggesting that the cells activate compensatory mechanisms such as glycolysis and CRC pathway (Fendt et al., 2013; Posho et al., 1998). Glutamate generation can account for up to 40% of glutamine utilization in Caco-2 (Posho et al., 1998), and it is known that glutamine is a very important metabolic fuel and biosynthesis precursor for intestinal epithelium (Costa et al., 2000). We can also note that the cancerous origins of Caco-2 give them the ability to rapidly use glycolysis as a source of energy, commonly known as the Warburg effect (Klepinina et al., 2021). Unlike Caco-2, the Huh7 cells showed no change in ECAR nor glutamate (Figure 5-figure supplement 2b) after SNC80 treatment, suggesting that cells did not compensate mitochondrial impairment with increased glycolytic activity or CRC. SNC80 must therefore decrease total ATP production, which was confirmed by detection of a significant drop in the ATP/ADP ratio within liver epithelial cells expressing a fluorescent reporter (Figure 5-figure supplement 1b). When looking at endothelial cells, 2 hr of SNC80 treatment in HUVEC and LSEC reduced mitochondrial ATP production (Figure 5-figure supplement 1a), indicating a decrease in mitochondrial activity and slowing of metabolism. However, it did not alter OCR. We hypothesize that because endothelial cells are highly glycolytic (De Bock et al., 2013) with a low baseline metabolic activity (data not shown), that SNC80's effect on mitochondrial respiration does not change gut endothelial cell oxygen consumption. HUVEC and LSEC showed no change in ECAR or glutamate (Figure 5-figure supplement 2b), suggesting that the cells are not compensating with additional glycolysis or CRC and that therefore the overall ATP production in the cell line is decreased. Taken together, these results indicate that all four human cell types showed significant decreases in mitochondrial metabolism in response to the biostasis inducer SNC80. However, Caco-2 cells were the only ones that activated compensatory pathways in response to the impaired mitochondrial respiration, while others just allowed for their energy balance to decrease significantly. Our studies also suggested that the metabolism-suppressing effects of SNC80 were most potent in the epithelial cells that were originally derived from highly metabolic tumors (Wan et al., 2022).",

      "text": "To explore whether this drug also induces a state of biostasis in human cells and tissues, as well as non-cardiac cells, we tested SNC80 in human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices that reconstitute tissue-tissue interfaces and human organ-level physiology with high fidelity in vitro (Ingber, 2022). The Organ Chip models reconstitute a tissue-tissue interface between organ-specific epithelium and endothelium across a porous extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated membrane within a two-channel microfluidic device, and hence allow tissue-tissue cross-talk observed in vivo that is not normally present in studies with cultured cells, as previously described (Si et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2016). In this study, we used a Gut Chip lined by Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells interfaced with HUVECs and a Liver Chip containing Huh7 liver epithelial cells interfaced with LSECs, respectively. However, we modified the Organ Chip design by integrating sensors that allow for live monitoring of oxygen (O2) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (tissue barrier function) (Figure 5-figure supplement 3a). Both Organ Chips were treated with SNC80 by flowing the drug in medium for 2 days through the apical and basal channels of the chip, and then removing the drug followed by 7 days of additional culture. We confirmed that the intestinal epithelial cells underwent villus differentiation and accumulated mucus under these culture conditions (Figure 5-figure supplement 3b), in addition to maintaining a low oxygen environment after 10-16 days of culture (Figure 5-figure supplement 3c) as previously described (Si et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2016). The Liver Chips also produced albumin and urea at levels (5 and 135 µg/day/chip, respectively) (Figure 5-figure supplement 3d and e) that were similar to those measured in Organ Chips lined by primary hepatocytes (Choi et al., 2016; Ewart et al., 2021). These studies revealed that SNC80 treatment reduced the respiratory (oxygen utilization) rate in the Gut Chip, resulting in an almost sixfold increase in extracellular oxygen levels after 48 hr, which then progressively returned to baseline levels during the 7-day washout period (Figure 5a). Similar results were obtained with the more highly metabolic Liver Chip with SNC80 inducing higher levels of extracellular oxygen compared to control chips and this again reversed after drug washout (Figure 5a). Importantly, the tissues in both the human Organ Chips remained healthy after 2 days' treatment with SNC80 as there was no significant change in barrier function (Figure 5-figure supplement 4a and b), cell growth (Figure 5-figure supplement 3g), or cytotoxicity (Figure 5-figure supplement 4c and d). Similar to the data observed in cell cultures, ATP/ADP ratio in Liver Chips was significantly decreased after 24 and 48 hr of SNC80 treatment compared to the vehicle control chips. However, ATP/ADP ratio measurements between SNC80 and vehicle control were not significantly different after washout of the drug, indicating that Liver Chip tissues recover their normal metabolic function up to 4 days after treatment (Figure 5b). Collectively, these data suggest that treatment with SNC80 in these physiologically relevant human cells and tissues cultured on-chip in an organ-relevant context resulted in a drop in respiration, with no switch toward glycolysis or reductive carboxylation, since the levels of lactate (Figure 5-figure supplement 4e and f) and glutamate remained unchanged in both chips (Figure 5-figure supplement 4g and h). Thus, in this organ-like microenvironment, the tissues decrease their total ATP production in presence of SNC80, which is accompanied by a global slowing of metabolism.",

In the present study, treatment with SNC80 slowed swimming movement and reduced OCR in a reversible manner in Xenopus tadpoles, and it lowered the metabolic rate in non-mobile Xenopus embryos as well. Increased levels of acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester in the SNC80-treated Xenopus suggested a specific reduction in fatty acid metabolism activity, similar to the metabolic changes observed in hibernating brown bears and ground squirrels (Soeters et al., 2009; Welinder et al., 2016; Otis et al., 2011). Importantly, SNC80 displayed similar metabolism suppressing activities that were reversible in physiologically relevant human Organ Chip microfluidic devices that reconstitute organ-level structures and functions in vitro. These experiments also aided in the dose selection for SNC80 (100 µM), which was chosen to maximize suppression of metabolic and activity parameters, while ensuring reversibility of biostasis. These data suggested that induction of a hypometabolic state by this small molecular drug could potentially provide a new paradigm to prolong organ preservation. Indeed, when we perfused explanted porcine hearts and limbs with SNC80, we experimentally confirmed that this biostasis agent can slow metabolism in a whole complex living organs, providing direct support for its potential integration into commercial organ preservation devices that strive to extend the viability of human organs for surgical transplantation.",
