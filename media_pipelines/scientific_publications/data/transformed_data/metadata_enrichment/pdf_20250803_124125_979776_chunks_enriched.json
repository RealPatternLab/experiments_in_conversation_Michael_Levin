      "text": "Limb and organ repair is crucial, with millions affected by amputations.  Ideal solutions would trigger in vivo limb-building pathways. Despite research on regeneration mechanisms, rebuilding lost limbs in non-regenerative animals remains challenging, highlighting the need for a tractable vertebrate model. Many animals regenerate appendages, unlike humans, despite genetic similarities. Xenopus laevis, like axolotls, regenerates limbs, but this ability declines developmentally, resulting in hypomorphic cartilage spikes in later stages. Previous work induced tail regeneration in non-regenerative Xenopus using systemic drug cocktails targeting bioelectric states, but this approach is limited due to widespread bioelectric signaling. This study aims to develop targeted small-molecule delivery in adults for localized, brief interventions to improve regeneration.",
