In vitro models using human cells have advanced understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis, but they don't fully replicate the microcephalic phenotype. In vivo mouse models have limitations, including the need for immunocompromised strains and not fully replicating human microcephaly.  No model has combined human neural cells with an in vivo organism to study systemic virus effects and drug treatment on human neurons. We used human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) for in vitro and in vivo ZIKV infection models. hiNSCs differentiate into neurons and integrate into chick embryo nervous systems.

      "text": "The chick embryo was chosen for the in vivo model because it allows intracranial injection of human neural stem cells, has rapid brain development, and has a naturally immunodeficient system suitable for xenografts and viral infection. Intracranial injection of hiNSCs followed by systemic ZIKV infection via the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) caused microcephaly in chick embryos, including reduced cranial size, decreased forebrain volume, and enlarged ventricles.  NIC treatment partially rescued ZIKV-induced microcephaly and attenuated hiNSC infection in vivo. This humanized model is unique in studying systemic virus effects on human neurons. The CAM delivery method is physiologically relevant, mimicking transplacental delivery.  High-dose NIC treatment without ZIKV infection had no adverse effects on embryonic development, suggesting it may not be teratogenic. This model can be used to validate other treatments and study other infectious agents affecting brain development.",

ZIKV-infected hiNSCs secreted cytokines and growth factors like CXCL10, LIF, and VEGF, which were also upregulated at the mRNA level. NIC treatment partially reduced their expression. ZIKV infection altered hiNSC differentiation, increasing VGAT (GABAergic marker) and decreasing VGLUT2 (glutamatergic marker) expression.

ZIKV also caused reduced body length, potentially due to hiNSC migration or systemic effects of secreted factors.
