      "text": "The degree of conservation among phyla of early mechanisms that pattern the left-right (LR) axis is poorly understood. Sea urchin larvae exhibit consistently oriented LR asymmetry, with the adult rudiment forming from the left coelomic sac (left hydrocoel). This left preference is conserved among echinoderm larvae, but its mechanism is largely unknown. This study investigates the possibility that ion flux mechanisms control asymmetry in sea urchins, similar to vertebrates, using two asymmetrically expressed marker genes, HpNot and HpFoxFQ-like, in Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Several ion-transporter inhibitors were screened, and H+/K+-ATPase blockers (omeprazole, lansoprazole, SCH28080) and a calcium ionophore (A23187) altered the normal sidedness of asymmetric gene expression. Omeprazole disrupted consistent adult rudiment formation asymmetry. H+/K+-ATPase-like antigens were present through the blastula stage and exhibited asymmetry, being present in a single blastomere in 32-cell embryos. These results suggest that spatially-regulated early transport of H+, K+, and Ca2+ is involved in establishing LR asymmetry in sea urchin development.",

      "text": "Consistent asymmetries of organs are found in many animal phyla. Molecular mechanisms establishing LR asymmetry have been studied in vertebrates, revealing a conserved cascade involving Nodal and Pitx2. However, the initial symmetry-breaking step and early mechanisms are less understood. One model proposes that nodal monocilia propel fluid containing determinants to the left side, potentially involving mechano-sensitive cells and calcium signaling. Alternative mechanisms have been suggested in frogs and chicks. Levin et al. demonstrated that side-specific membrane hyperpolarization by H+/K+-ATPase plays a critical role, possibly by regulating signaling or electrophoretic movement of determinants. Another study suggests Notch signaling activation through localized extracellular calcium elevation induced by H+/K+-ATPase. The evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms and their relevance in invertebrates is debated. Echinoderms, including sea urchins, show LR asymmetry during development. The adult rudiment forms on the left side during the late larval stage. While mechanisms for primary and oral-aboral axes are clearer, the LR axis mechanism remains elusive. Manipulation experiments suggest commitment to left adult rudiment formation from gastrula to prism stages by an influence from the right side.",

H,K-ATPase-like antigens are asymmetrically localized in early embryos. These findings extend previous work and implicate H,K-ATPase as a crucial component of invertebrate LR patterning. The H,K-ATPase is a P-type ATPase with α- and β-subunits. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are benzimidazoles activated in acidic environments, inhibiting H,K-ATPase by reacting with cysteine residues. SCH28080 is a specific antagonist targeting a distinct site. These compounds are effective H,K-ATPase blockers in various organisms. While H,K-ATPase genes are uncharacterized in sea urchins, their functional existence is suggested. Three H,K-ATPase inhibitors with different mechanisms disrupted sidedness of asymmetric markers at physiological concentrations. Other ion channel/pump inhibitors had no effect, indicating that asymmetry is not generally labile in sea urchins. Treatments did not disturb other axes, ruling out secondary effects.
