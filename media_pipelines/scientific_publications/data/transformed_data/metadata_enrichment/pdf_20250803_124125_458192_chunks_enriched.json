      "text": "Membrane potential depolarization causes alterations in neuron arrangement and connectivity in cocultures. The disruption of neuron arrangement is associated with several pathologies. In contrast to action potentials, the role of resting potential (Vmem) in regulating connectivity remains unknown. Neuron assemblies were quantified when their Vmem was depolarized using ivermectin (Ivm), a drug that opens chloride channels, for 24 h in cocultures with astrocytes. Cell aggregation was analyzed using automated cluster analysis methods. Neural connectivity was quantified based on the identification of isolated somas in phase-contrast images using image processing. Vmem was measured using voltage-sensitive dyes and whole-cell patch clamping. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were used to detect changes in the distribution and production of the proteins. Data show that Vmem regulates cortical tissue shape and connectivity. Automated cluster analysis methods revealed that the degree of neural aggregation was significantly increased (0.26 clustering factor vs. 0.21 in controls, P < 0.01). The number of beta-tubulin III positive neural projections was also significantly increased in the neural aggregates in cocultures with Ivm. Hyperpolarized neuron cells formed fewer connections (33% at 24 h, P < 0.05) compared to control cells in 1-day cultures. Glia cell densities increased (33.3%, P ≤ 0.05) under depolarizing conditions. Vmem can be a useful tool to probe neuronal cells, disease tissues models, and cortical tissue arrangements.",

      "text": "Cortical arrangement, including shape and size at the cellular and tissue levels, relates to neural connectivity associated with normal brain development and function. Neural assemblies are diffuse structures comprising cells in the cortex and diencephalon capable of acting briefly as a closed system, delivering facilitation to other such systems. They are implicated in complex brain functions such as learning or planning, and accepted as the smallest representatives of a cognitive concept in the brain, as explained in Hebbian theory. Neural assemblies are suggested to constitute neural syntaxes that integrate and parse the fundamental assemblies of neural activities. Deficits in neuronal organization and connectivity can result in a range of pathologies, including corticobasal syndrome, autism, epilepsy, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and social anxiety disorder. The deformation or volume change in cortical tissue occurs in several neurological diseases, such as dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and schizophrenia. Brain morphometric studies have revealed focal abnormalities in several areas of the brain, including the cortex, in schizophrenia patients. Volume loss and cortical thinning were found in the medial temporal lobe of individuals with schizophrenia when compared with control groups. Also, correlations between structural measures and memory performance in schizophrenia subjects were demonstrated. Significant variations in shape have been reported in the frontobasal brain region in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Reductions in cortical thickness in the left hemisphere and a lack of integrity of white matter is a main contributor to long-term impairment in declarative memory among patients suffering from severe and diffuse traumatic brain injury. A recent study verified that cortical thinning is observable/quantifiable and is functionally relevant in blast-related traumatic brain injury patients. Interestingly, regardless of the disease-induced cause, a decline in cortex volume has also been identified in elderly. However, it is still not known which cell types in number, density, or size in the brain are disturbed related to neurological disorders.",

      "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging of clinical subjects is the most common approach used to assess functional brain anatomy. This analytical approach provides rapid and general diagnosis for clinical purposes, but lacks spatial resolution at the cellular level, which is important to elucidate the mechanisms of disease and development. In vitro model systems and automated quantitative analysis tools are needed to achieve insight into disease mechanisms and to implement approaches for disease control and therapy. Vmem can regulate cell differentiation as undifferentiated cells exhibit relatively depolarized Vmem compared to terminally differentiated cells. The underlying mechanism for that is the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. It has long been known that activity of the nervous system during embryogenesis helps regulate differentiation, proliferation, and topology of the nascent CNS. However, despite the exciting recent data indicating roles for resting potential gradients in embryonic patterning of many organs, the roles of Vmem in neural connectivity remain unknown. The objective of this study was to develop a novel approach to mimic and detect abnormalities in cortical tissue arrangement based on changes in the neuron arrangement, as well as shape and size of neural cell assemblies. Ivm is known to change the cellular chloride content. Ivm can change the Vmem specifically by binding to Glycine Receptor Chloride Channel alpha-1 subunit. That makes Ivm a specifically targeted and a convenient tool to change the Vmem in cells expressing the channel. We found that Ivm can affect both astrocytes and neurons, as western blot studies revealed that GlyR was produced also in astrocytes. However, the ability of Ivm to affect Vmem was in different time windows for neurons and astrocytes. Ivm caused a relatively hyperpolarized Vmem in astrocytes alone at 2w and 4w where it reversed neuron Vmem (depolarized) at 3 weeks in presence of astrocytes versus the controls. Using intrinsic chloride-dependent Vmem shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in developing neurons, cortical shape and connectivity were controlled with a Vmem-specific manner using Ivm. The data reveal that changes in gross cortical anatomy can be recapitulated at the cellular level, and suggest Vmem as a useful tool to establish in vitro models for both normal and diseased cortex.",

      "text": "Cortical size and shape are clinical measures for functional brain disorders. Many disorders can be diagnosed using volumetric measurements, including fMRI and PET scans. However, these tools lack cellular-level resolution needed to understand the mechanisms of anatomical abnormalities. Understanding the cell physiological basis of brain diseases is crucial for characterizing disorders and establishing realistic in vitro models for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This study shows that Vmem can change cortical tissue arrangement, shape, size, and neural connectivity in vitro. Mature cortical neurons aggregated and formed assemblies when their Vmem was depolarized. These assemblies varied in size. Hypotheses for the molecular signatures of neuron assemblies are mostly characterized based on firing patterns. Membrane potential regulation of cell connectivity is an area of ongoing research.",
