      "text": "Vertebrate embryos develop distinct left-right asymmetry under the control of a conserved pathway involving left-sided deployment of the nodal and Pitx2 genes. The mechanism that initiates asymmetric expression of these genes is less clear, with cilia, ion flux, and signalling molecules all implicated. Vertebrates share the chordate phylum with urochordates such as the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. We have explored the role of ion flux in regulating left-right asymmetry in Ciona, using an assay in which perturbation of left-sided Ci-Pitx expression provides a read-out for the disruption of asymmetry. Our data show that omeprazole, which specifically inhibits H+K+ATPase activity, disrupts asymmetry in Ciona. The vertebrate H+K+ATPase is composed of two subunits, a and ß. We identified one Ciona ß ortholog and two Ciona a orthologs of the vertebrate H+K+ATPase genes, and show that one of these is expressed in dorsal and ventral embryonic midline cells shortly before the activation of left-sided Ci-Pitx expression. Furthermore, we show that omeprazole exerts its effect on asymmetry at this point in development, and additionally implicate K+ channels in the regulation of asymmetry in Ciona. These experiments demonstrate a role for ion flux in the regulation of asymmetry in Ciona, and show a conserved, ancestral role for the H+K+ATPase ion pump in this process.",

Most members of the Bilateria, however, deviate from bilateral symmetry in a predictable manner. This is known as directional left-right (LR) asymmetry, and has been documented in arthropods, annelids, molluscs, vertebrates, and many other phyla (Palmer, 1996). The regulation of LR asymmetry has been studied in representatives of several phyla, and an intriguing finding that has emerged from this work is that, unlike the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes, there is currently little evidence for conservation of the genes or developmental processes regulating LR asymmetry in different phyla (for example see Palmer, 1996; Delattre and Felix, 2001; Hayashi and Murakami, 2001; Ligoxygakis et al., 2001). One interpretation of this lack of conservation is that directional asymmetry may have evolved repeatedly (Palmer, 1996, 2004).",

      "text": "Many studies have investigated the molecular control of LR asymmetry in vertebrates (reviewed by Levin, 2005). One key finding of these studies is that the homeobox transcription factor Pitx2 and the secreted signalling molecules nodal and lefty play a critical role in establishing differences between the left and right sides. Nodal gene expression is activated on the left side of the node, and appears to initiate a transcriptional cascade that results in the activation of nodal and Pitx2 gene expression to the left side of the embryonic midline (Levin et al., 1995; Brennan et al., 2002; Saijoh et al., 2003). A central focus of recent studies has been the mechanisms that result in the initial asymmetric activation of nodal. In mouse embryos, node cells have an unusual sort of primary cilia. Unlike most primary cilia, which are immobile, these beat in a co-ordinated manner to generate a flow of liquid across the node, and experimental evidence suggests interfering or reversing this flow can predictably disrupt the development of asymmetry (Nonaka et al., 1998, 2002). Consistent with this are the results of several genetic studies, which show that mice mutant for intracellular components related to ciliary function have defects in LR asymmetric development (Supp et al., 1997; Marszalek et al., 1999; Okada et al., 1999; Takeda et al., 1999; Pennekamp et al., 2002; Yoder et al., 2002). Cilia have been detected on the cells of the node equivalents of other vertebrates. However, alternative explanations for the role of nodal cilia in vertebrate asymmetry have been proposed (McGrath et al., 2003; Tabin and Vogan, 2003; Essner et al., 2005; Kawakami et al., 2005; Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005; Okada et al., 2005).",

The chordates form part of the deuterostomes, a taxon they share with the hemichordates and echinoderms. All members of the Urochordata and Cephalochordata have a characteristic chordate body plan at some point in their life cycle, including a dorsal, hollow neural tube and a notochord. Both also develop asymmetries that can be directly related to vertebrate asymmetries (Boorman and Shimeld, 2002a). Single Pitx and nodal genes have been characterised in amphioxus and ascidians, and both are expressed on the left side of the embryo at a developmental stage where the chordate body plan has been established (Yasui et al., 2000; Boorman and Shimeld, 2002b; Morokuma et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2002). Recently, omeprazole has been shown to disrupt LR asymmetry in sea urchins, suggesting ion flux may be conserved in all deuterostomes (Duboc et al., 2005). In this report, we examine the role of ion flux in LR asymmetry of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (hereafter referred to as Ciona).

      "text": "Ciona eggs are enclosed by a chorion and, exterior to the chorion, by numerous small follicle cells. Removal of the chorion is a critical part of many established protocols for manipulating Ciona embryos, including blastomere ablation, transplantation, and electroporation. Test cells, which are maternally derived but differ from follicle cells and have a role in early tunic formation, come to lie between the chorion and the egg. Fertilised eggs develop within the chorion until the early larval phase, when hatching occurs. Fertilised eggs can be chemically dechorionated, and develop normally up to the tailbud stage. Metamorphosis of dechorionated larvae is, however, typically abnormal, and this has been suggested to be caused by the absence of test cells, which are lost during dechorionation. We initially considered removing the chorion prior to experimentation, to improve access of pharmacological reagents to the embryo. However, since the removal of the chorion can disrupt asymmetry in some vertebrates, we first examined whether dechorionation disrupted asymmetry in Ciona. We dechorionated embryos, and allowed them to develop to the tailbud stage before fixation. Control embryos from the same batch were grown within their chorions, then dechorionated immediately prior to fixation. Both were examined for Ci-Pitx expression. Control embryos showed the previously reported pattern of Ci-Pitx expression, with transcripts localised to the buccal cavity and to left-sided epidermis. Conversely, 84% of dechorionated embryos showed Ci-Pitx expression in both left and right epidermis. This result shows that dechorionation disrupts the normal asymmetric localisation of Ci-Pitx.",

      "text": "Since dechorionation can disrupt asymmetry, we focused future experiments on Ciona embryos grown within their chorions. First, we exposed embryos to a number of compounds that affect different ATP-dependent ion pumps. In vertebrate embryos, it is important to consider the status of the midline in such experiments, as midline tissues act as barriers between left and right sides. Disruption of midline development leads to secondary disruption of LR asymmetry. It is also important to avoid the generalised teratogenic effects many compounds will induce if used at sufficiently high concentration. Consequently, all compounds were screened in preliminary experiments to identify concentrations below which embryonic development appeared normal (with normal germ layer development and midline tissue morphogenesis) but above which development was compromised. Experiments were then conducted using reagent concentrations below this threshold. Treated embryos were grown until the tailbud stage, then dechorionated, and subjected to in situ hybridisation for and scored for Ci-Pitx expression. The results show that only one tested compound, omeprazole, significantly disrupted asymmetric Ci-Pitx expression. Omeprazole blocks the H+K+ATPase, which has a role in regulating LR asymmetry in some vertebrates. Specifically, omeprazole forms a cationic sulfenamide in an acidic environment (such as that created internally by the H+K+ATPase) and binds covalently to the a subunit, blocking H+K+ATPase activity in organisms as diverse as vertebrates and protozoa. The specificity of action has made omeprazole a popular clinical treatment for targeting gastric H+K+ATPase activity in the control of excess stomach acid production. We then conducted a more focused experiment, exposing embryos to different concentrations of omeprazole from fertilisation to the tailbud stage, at which point they were dechorionated, fixed, and assayed for Ci-Pitx expression. Embryos exposed to 4 µg/ml or 10 µg/ml omeprazole were not significantly different from controls. Embryos exposed to 20 µg/ml or 40 µg/ml omeprazole showed a significantly increased disruption of asymmetric Ci-Pitx expression, such that at 40 µg/ml over 40% of embryos had ectopic right-sided epidermal Ci-Pitx expression. Other aspects of embryonic development, including AP and DV morphology, midline tissue morphogenesis, and the expression of Ci-Pitx in the buccal cavity, appeared normal in these embryos, indicating the effect of the treatment was specific to LR development. This suggests that the Ciona equivalent of the vertebrate H+K+ATPase is involved in the development of LR asymmetry.",

Vertebrate H+K+ATPase subunit genes share sequence identity with Na+K+-ATPases, which have been identified in several invertebrate species and are present in multiple copies in vertebrate genomes. We searched Ciona cDNA and genomic resources for genes with similar sequence to both subunits from both H+K+ATPase and the Na+K+ATPases. Our searches identified two α subunits and one β subunit. Similar searches of the genome of the congenic urochordate Ciona savignyi identified the same gene complement, indicating we had identified the full set of subunit genes in Ciona. To determine the evolutionary relationships of these vertebrate and invertebrate genes with the Ciona genes, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses. These showed that the Ciona α subunit genes were closely related to each other, and that both were basal to all the vertebrate H+K+ATPase and Na+K+ATPase α subunit genes. Similarly, the Ciona β subunit gene was basal to all the vertebrate H+K+ATPase and Na+K+ATPase β subunit genes. This demonstrates that the vertebrate H+K+ATPase and multiple Na+K+ATPase genes have evolved by gene duplications specific to the vertebrate lineage, after its separation from the lineage leading to Ciona.

Consequently, we then monitored the timing of staining to distinguish weak and strong expression. Our results showed the Ci-β subunit gene and the Ci-αA subunit gene to be ubiquitously expressed from fertilisation, with expression particularly strong in the central nervous system of tailbud stage embryos. We did not, however, detect expression of the Ci-αB subunit gene until the tailbud stage, when transcripts were detected in ventral then dorsal midline epidermis.

Second, that dechorionation also affected LR patterning, as determined by Ci-Pitx expression. These results suggest that ion flux might play an in vivo role in the regulation of LR asymmetry in Ciona. The effect of dechorionation is, however, problematic, as it compromises many of the techniques, such as microinjection and electroporation, commonly used to manipulate Ciona embryos. The reasons why dechorionation affects asymmetry remain unknown; possible factors could be exposure of the dechorionated zygote to different mechanical forces, enzymatic activity or ionic environment, or the removal of the test cells that normally attached to the inside of the chorion. We note that, unlike the pharmacological manipulation discussed below, dechorionation resulted in most embryos expressing ectopic right-sided Ci-Pitx. Thus, dechorionation does not directly mimic the application of the H+K+ATPase blocker.",

Our results show a significant and concentration-dependent increase in ectopic right sided Ci-Pitx expression in embryos treated with omeprazole.

      "text": "The vertebrate H+K+ATPase is made from subunits deriving from two separate genes. The α subunit forms the core of the pump, and includes the binding sites for K⁺, H⁺, and ATP. The β subunit associates with the alpha subunit and is required for its function. Database searches identified two α and one β subunit genes in the Ciona genome. Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed the orthology of these genes to the vertebrate H+K+ATPase subunit genes, but also showed them to be equally related to the vertebrate Na+K+ATPase genes. While the different groups of vertebrate genes form clades with relatively strong support, the relationship between these clades is less clear, marked by low support values. Thus, it is not possible to conclude on the basis of the phylogeny of the chordate genes whether H+K+ATPase activity or Na+K+ATPase activity is primitive. Notably, omeprazole has been reported as binding covalently to cysteine residues in the active region of the α subunit, which spans transmembrane regions M5 and M6. Only one of the two predicted α subunit proteins in Ciona, Ci-αB, contains a cysteine in this region, suggesting this may be the target residue for omeprazole.",

In Xenopus, H+K+ATPase activity becomes asymmetric very early in development, during cleavage stages. In chick embryos, H+K+ATPase activity appears to regulate asymmetry relatively late in development, during gastrulation. To examine timing in Ciona, we conducted a time course of omeprazole treatment. The results showed that omeprazole affects LR asymmetry in Ciona relatively late in development. No effect was observed from treatment prior to gastrulation, with the strongest effect from treatment during the neurula and tailbud stages. Notably, this is the period when clear AP and DV axes become apparent in Ciona, including the formation of definitive midline structures such as the notochord. It also coincides with the activation of Ci-αB expression in the epidermis at the early tailbud stage, and precedes the activation of asymmetric Ci-Pitx. As such, it is more similar to the timing of H+K+ATPase activity in the chick embryo than in the Xenopus embryo.",

It is possible this reflects convergent co-option of mechanisms in the two lineages, as suggested by Palmer (2004) for other aspects of the evolution of asymmetry. The most likely explanation for this similarity, however, is that it reflects conservation of a primitive mechanism that was present in the common ancestor of the chordates. The implication of this is that all living chordates have evolved from this starting point, suggesting it is likely to be present in vertebrate lineages that have yet to be fully studied at this level, such as elasmobranches and agnathans. There are also differences between urochordates and vertebrates with respect to the development of LR asymmetry. First, our manipulation of ion flux in urochordates never resulted in full reversal of symmetry, whereas in some vertebrates reversal is observed. Omeprazole-treated embryos fell into three categories: embryos that appeared normal, embryos with ectopic right Ci-Pitx expression, and embryos with no Ci-Pitx expression. The latter could reflect embryos in which the left side had developed right-sided character. This range of phenotypes is, however, similar to that observed for Shh expression in chick embryos treated with omeprazole or with gap junction inhibitors.",

      "text": "Second, in Ciona the mechanisms regulating asymmetry seem to operate in the epidermis, an ectodermal tissue, while in vertebrates the node and then mesoderm are the sites where asymmetry is regulated. The reason for these differences is unknown. However, many aspects of early Ciona development are very different from those of vertebrates. Cleavage is stereotypical, with a high reliance on cytoplasmic determinants and concomitant lineage-dependent mechanisms for determining major tissue types. Gastrulation occurs after only a few cell divisions, in embryos with a small number of large cells, and there is no direct equivalent of the node in Ciona. These differences probably reflect adaptive change in the urochordate lineage to produce an embryo capable of rapidly forming a motile larva, something relatively common for organisms with planktonic eggs and presumably reflecting selection to avoid predation in the plankton. However, whether the differences in LR patterning mechanisms between Ciona and vertebrates reflect changes driven by similar selective pressures remains unknown, as without an outgroup it is impossible to determine whether vertebrates, urochordates, or either represent the ancestral state. Study of asymmetry mechanisms in other deuterostome phyla might help resolve this issue, and recent data from Duboc et al. (2005) suggest ion flux may indeed be primitive for deuterostomes. Additionally, it will be important to determine if other aspects of the molecular pathway controlling asymmetry in multiple vertebrate lineages, for example the use of Notch signalling, are also used by Ciona. Finally, our data implicate K⁺ channels in regulating LR asymmetry in Ciona. Future work will involve identifying the specific genes involved and investigating their relative importance in LR asymmetry.",
