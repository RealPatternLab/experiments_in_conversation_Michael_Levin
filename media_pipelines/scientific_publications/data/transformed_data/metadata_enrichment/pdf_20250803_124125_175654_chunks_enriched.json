      "text": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in developmental biology and biomedicine, driving processes like embryogenesis and influencing cell behavior throughout life. Understanding GRN dynamics is essential for both developmental biology and disease management. While much research has focused on rewiring GRNs to control outcomes, this can be challenging in biomedical settings. This paper explores an alternative strategy: controlling GRN behavior through inputs – spatiotemporally regulated stimuli – that remodel the attractor landscape, effectively shaping the system's \"memory.\" This approach aims to control network behavior without transgenes or genomic editing, offering a novel method for controlling complex in vivo dynamics.",

This involves identifying stimulus genes (inputs) and response genes (outputs) within a Boolean GRN model.  The focus is on two types of stimulus nodes – unconditional stimulus (UCS) and neutral stimulus (NS) – and a single response node (R).  The UCS triggers R, while the NS is initially neutral but can be conditioned to activate R through paired stimulation with the UCS, similar to classical conditioning.  This approach aims to identify temporal stimulation regimes that achieve desired changes in response activity without altering the network's structure.",

Larger RBNs exhibited all memory types, with increasing non-UM types in 20 and 25-node networks.  Similar trends were observed in biological GRNs, although the relationship was less strictly size-dependent.

Analysis of configuration models revealed that the presence of one memory type is statistically related to the likelihood of finding other memory types.  Biological GRNs showed higher conditional entropy (ordered correlation) between memory types compared to randomized models, indicating that certain GRN architectures support multiple memory types simultaneously.  For example, the presence of AM (especially LRAM) correlated with other memory types, while UM and TM showed strong correlation in biological GRNs.  These findings suggest that memory potentials are not independent and that the existence of some memory types can predict the presence of others.",
