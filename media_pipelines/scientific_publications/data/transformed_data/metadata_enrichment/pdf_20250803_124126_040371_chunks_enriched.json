Each signal has its own semantics, but context can depend on unpredictable boundary conditions. Context change is problematic if joint probability distributions are undefined, occurring when QRFs don't commute. This affects deep learning using VAEs. The structure of Diagram 3 in Part I can benchmark signal transduction networks for co-deployable versus non-co-deployable QRFs.",

      "text": "\\\"Quantum\\\" context effects due to non-commutativity have been reported even in human language use. The \\\"Snow Queen\\\" experiment challenged subjects with inconsistent meanings of terms in different contexts, detecting statistically-significant context effects using the CbD formalism. These effects cannot be explained by linguistic ambiguity. Language-driven contextuality is studied in psycholinguistics and distributional semantics, combining CbD and sheaf theoretic methods to analyze semantic ambiguity. While \\\"languages\\\" applied to cells and tissues is metaphorical, linguistic approaches may be useful for understanding context dependence and ambiguity in biology. Immune cell responses can be dysfunctional due to context changes, seen as discrepancies between signal semantics and the immune system's \\\"language.\\\" Similar context effects observed in microbiological systems, like lactose-glucose interference in E.

      "text": "Further research in quantum biology may offer insights into human physiology and cognition. Allostasis regulates physiological conditions relative to costs and benefits, dynamically allocating resources for adaptability. Visceromotor cortical regions generate autonomic, hormonal, and immunological predictions for interoceptive inference. This inference putatively utilizes predictive coding for homeostasis-allostasis through a hierarchy of systems, connecting interoception to extercoception and proprioception. Allostasis protects against surprise by minimizing free energy of internal states. The Good Regulator theorem shows that regulation requires an internal model. An integrated allostatic-interoceptive cortical system supports psychological phenomena like memory and emotions. Cognitive conditions like depression and autism have been described as abnormalities of allostatic-interoceptive inference, impairing predictive coding due to aberrant assimilation of prediction errors.",
