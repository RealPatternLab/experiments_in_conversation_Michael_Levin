      "text": "Aging is a complex biological process involving morphological and functional decline, ultimately leading to death. While lifespan manipulation has seen progress in model organisms, the core mechanisms of human aging remain unclear.  A comprehensive computational platform for predicting aging in multicellular systems and integrating the multiscale competency of lifeforms is lacking. This research focuses on the processes that build and maintain complex anatomy and proposes that aging occurs even without accumulated cellular or genetic damage because a homeodynamic system without an anatomical goal will degrade. This degradation happens because evolution prioritizes development over morphostasis, leaving organisms with limited reinforcement of anatomical goals after development.",

Damage-based theories attribute aging to accumulated molecular damage affecting cellular components like the genome, telomeres, mitochondria, and proteins due to imperfect repair mechanisms. Programmatic theories suggest aging is genetically predetermined, not solely due to stochastic damage accumulation. This research proposes a different hypothesis: aging arises from a proto-cognitive dysfunction in the cellular collective, not requiring damage or evolved antagonistic mechanisms.  Like animal behavior, cellular systems without goals tend to degrade.  Aging is hypothesized to result from the intrinsic dynamics of complex cybernetic systems, not external noise or damage, consistent with theories proposing additional dynamics leading to loss of anatomical homeostasis setpoints, accelerated by various damages.",

However, the focus is not on specific genes but on the role of large-scale morphogenetic plasticity in establishing and maintaining bodies and potential disorders of such goal-driven processes.  The indirect link between genotype and phenotype is emphasized, highlighting the active homeodynamic capabilities of the morphogenetic layer in aligning cells with anatomical setpoints. Living materials navigate possible organ and tissue arrangements from diverse initial states (e.g., single cells, metamorphosis, damaged bodies). This process, described as collective intelligence, involves growth, remodeling, and component replacement. Like other advanced intelligences, it is subject to specific failure modes originating not from organic disease or damage but from the informational dead end of completing its mission without a new setpoint.",

The commitment to a specific navigation path in anatomical space, which binds cells into a coherent embryo, disappears at the global scale after development.
