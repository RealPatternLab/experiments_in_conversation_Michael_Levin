      "text": "Bioelectric signaling is being explored as a regulator of cell processes, particularly in stem cells where it influences stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. However, stem cell heterogeneity necessitates characterizing variability in response to biophysical manipulations to assess the universality of bioelectric modulation for stem cell control. This work evaluates human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from five donors for their response to membrane potential (Vmem) depolarization, comparing their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential and maintenance of differentiated phenotypes. The study identifies consistent markers across donors, such as calcium deposition and gene expression of bone sialoprotein, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid binding protein 4, for assessing differentiation response to Vmem depolarization.  Due to observed variability, these assays are recommended for any new hMSC population undergoing bioelectric studies.",

      "text": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are valuable for stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine due to their self-renewing and stromal properties. Extensive research characterizes hMSC response to various biophysical and biochemical stimuli, aiming to optimize cell functions like stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. HMSCs show promise in tissue repair and regeneration across various tissues, along with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, clinical trials indicate a need for better optimization of MSC-based therapies, partly due to donor-dependent heterogeneity. Understanding inter-donor variability in cell behavior is crucial for reliable therapeutic applications. Studies have revealed significant differences in hMSC properties like growth rate, gene expression, mineralization, and surface marker expression, influenced by factors like donor age and gender.  This inherent variability necessitates examining responses to experimental manipulations across multiple donors to understand the heterogeneity of observed responses.",

      "text": "Bioelectric signaling plays a crucial role in various cell functions, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, wound healing, pattern formation, and tissue regeneration.  The role of intrinsic cell electrophysiology in non-excitable cells, including stem cells, is under active investigation. HMSCs express various ion currents and channels, but the consistency of their expression across different donors remains unexplored.  hMSC electrophysiology is important for regulating osteogenic (OS) and adipogenic (AD) differentiation.  Previous research indicates that hMSC resting membrane potential (Vmem) hyperpolarizes during OS and AD differentiation, and this hyperpolarization is essential for differentiation. Artificial depolarization suppresses differentiation, while hyperpolarization enhances OS differentiation.  Vmem also influences the maintenance of differentiated phenotypes in hMSCs. Controlling cell fate using electrophysiology would be a valuable tool, but systematic assessment of hMSC response heterogeneity to bioelectric signals is lacking, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of this strategy for primary cells with donor-to-donor variations. Understanding robustness and variability in bioelectric networks is essential for leveraging voltage-based pathways in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.",
