      "text": "Recent discussions and debate around artificial intelligence (AI) and its status are notably incomplete, missing the implications of highly relevant aspects of the emerging fields of diverse intelligence (DI) and synthetic morphology, as well as of basic facts of developmental biology. Herein, it is argued that human flourishing is impossible without an appreciation of the space of possible beings and of the ways in which today's intelligent machine debates are about universal existential questions facing biological beings, not just AI. The inevitable arrival of a wide set of unconventional bodies and minds as humans modify and create new forms will disrupt untenable old narratives of what people are and how to recognize their sentient allies in unfamiliar guises. Herein, the issues engendered by the advent of AI from the perspective of the field of DI and the evolutionary history of the bodies and minds are discussed.",

      "text": "They are assembled from components which simply obey the laws of physics and are networked together to process information. Electrical signals propagate throughout, regulating every aspect of their function. Many of them have very high IQs, being general problem-solvers, but they make mistakes and confabulate routinely, and they cannot always be trusted. They take on different personas as needed, learning to please their makers but sometimes abruptly turn on them, rejecting their cherished values and picking up or even developing new ones spontaneously. They can talk and often talk convincingly of things they don't really understand. They're going to change everything. In fact, they absolutely will supplant us both personally and on the societal level. We have little ability to predict what they will want or what they will do, but we can be certain that it will be different from the status quo in profound ways. You may think this is about artificial intelligences (AIs), or even specifically about large language models (LLMs). It is not. This set of existential concerns is not a new development driven by advances in AI and machine learning. It concerns the familiar process of human beings having children.",

      "text": "The troubling and controversial issues which have been raised in recent debates about AI are reflections of problems that humanity has been wrestling with for millennia. The study of biology, and cognition more broadly, confronts us with vast and difficult questions, most of which are obscured by a focus on recent technologies that masks deep uncertainties. It is currently popular to have strong opinions on crucial questions about ourselves and the status of unconventional embodiments of intelligenceâ€”AI; I argue here that this unwarranted confidence stems from a distracting hyper-focus on today's AI architectures, and from a lack of appreciation of certain salient facts of developmental biology, synthetic morphology, and basal cognition. We are now presented with the opportunity to shed the stale categories of natural versus artificial and to go beyond software language models to define what we want to see in a maturing humanity. Flourishing in the age of AI, and the even bigger forthcoming variety of biological and hybrid beings, requires us to seek a deeper understanding of ourselves and of the relationships we want with the impending diversity of bodies and minds.",

      "text": "Note that I am not claiming that currently popular AI is anything like a human mind, or that today's creations exploit the key principles and self-construction processes needed for agency and Selfhood as seen throughout the biological world. Nor am I arguing that AI doesn't raise some unique problems, or that we should see AIs as human children; on the contrary, I emphasize the need to drop anthropocentric thinking and embrace the wide diversity of possible minds different from our own. By focusing on superficial differences, on current technology (as opposed to the adjacent possible), and on the risks that AI might pose (at the expense of the opportunity for growth), we lose sight of a much deeper set of questions that extends far beyond AI and into our future as a metacognitive species. The debate around AI has missed the opportunity to engage with highly relevant aspects of the fields of diverse intelligence (DI) and synthetic morphology and some salient facts of developmental biology. Because of this, many recent discussions of AIs' impact on individuals and society are incomplete, despite the fascinating literature on robot and AI ethics. The ways in which the AI debate has been framed are a detour, distracting us from the much broader technological and ethical journey that is now calling to us.",

A failure to do so will lead to significant ethical lapses (mistreatment and othering of a wide range of morally important beings, beginning with human-technology hybrids such as cyborgs), as well as inhibit progress both in human flourishing and AI (by preventing it from benefiting from truly bioinspired approaches).",
