Consistent organ asymmetry is crucial, as disorders of laterality form an important class of birth defects. In the frog embryo, we show that: 1) in contrast to the dominant paradigm, key steps of LR asymmetry are driven by intracellular (cytoskeletal) structures, and occur shortly after fertilization; 2) left-sided genes such as Nodal are not definitive master regulators of sidedness, as errors in their expression can be corrected by subsequent developmental stages. We propose a model of LR patterning as an example of parallel pathways and error-correction in complex morphogenesis driven by intracellular events.",

    "text": "Internal organs such as the heart, viscera, and brain display asymmetries in structure and positioning. Loss of correct laterality can result in pathologies contributing to congenital heart disease, a common birth defect. Thus, the embryonic origin of consistent laterality is important not only for fundamental questions of evolutionary developmental biology, but also has implications for a broad class of congenital malformations. The asymmetrical positioning and orientation of organs is highly conserved, but despite much recent investigation into the molecular pathways regulating left-right axis formation, there are still many unanswered questions about conservation of early mechanisms. One model relies on cilia-driven chiral extracellular fluid flow during neurulation. However, one of the many difficulties with that model as a general answer to the origin of left-right patterning is that numerous phyla establish asymmetry despite lack of cilia, or do so long before cilia are formed. This includes single cells, plants, snails, nematodes, fruit flies, and even amniotes such as chicken and pig. A divergent origin of such a fundamental property in even closely related species seems unlikely.",

    "text": "One of the barriers to resolving this problem is that the LR patterning roles of many specific gene products are often investigated in only one model system. Nevertheless, the cytoskeleton is emerging as a component that appears to be relevant to laterality in numerous phyla. We previously proposed the model that the intracellular cytoskeleton is an ancient, well-conserved mechanism by which embryos can, at the earliest stages of development, convert chiral molecular structures into true asymmetry of the entire bodyplan. To help unify the data from an evolutionary perspective, and test the opposing predictions of the ciliary vs. intracellular models, we asked: would the same mutations that randomize asymmetry in widely-disparate taxa, including those which do not use cilia, likewise impact asymmetry in the vertebrate *Xenopus laevis*? By microinjection of mRNA overexpressing wild type or dominant-negative mutants of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton-regulating proteins known to regulate asymmetry in very different types of bodyplans, we demonstrate that multiple components of the cytoskeleton are implicated in establishing frog laterality. Here we targeted proteins associated with microtubules and the actomyosin network, including structural proteins (α-tubulin), motor proteins (myosins), and moderators of post-translational modification of cytoskeletal components (Mgrn1, Lis1, ect2) with roles in asymmetry identified in *Arabidopsis*, *Drosophila*, and mouse.",

Consistent with a very broad conservation, the same targets were implicated in generating a consistent laterality across the tree of life. Notably, effects on organ positioning of the gut observed in *Drosophila* with *Myo31DF* overexpression are replicated in *Xenopus* with the frog homologue *MyolD*; and the dissociation of left-right organ positioning from Nodal expression observed in mouse mahogunin (*Mgrn1*) mutants is replicated in *Xenopus*. We show that some of these steps occur very soon after fertilization and not at later stages (when cilia could be functioning). This approach also allowed us to address curious discrepancies between molecular marker readouts (of left-side “master regulator\" genes) and actual organ situs, which have previously been noted. Indeed it had been proposed that a given species might have multiple overlapping/redundant mechanisms for establishing asymmetry, which could have practical consequences for approaches to biomedical disorders of laterality as well as implications for genes like Nodal as left-side \"master determinants\". Here, we show that some defects in asymmetric gene expression can be corrected at later points in development to subsequently give correct organ situs. This points to a robust mechanism for symmetry determination that occurs throughout embryogenesis and is not simply determined at a single point.",

    "text": "Disrupting microtubule architecture affects laterality. α-tubulin and Tubgcp2, a protein of the γ-tubulin complex, are components of the microtubule cytoskeleton that affect symmetry of axial organs in *Arabidopsis* and embryonic laterality in *Xenopus*. To determine if a mutant form of α-tubulin corresponding to a right-helical mutant which skews the direction of root growth has a similar effect on vertebrate laterality as other α-tubulin mutants identified in *Arabidopsis*, *Xenopus laevis* embryos were microinjected with mRNA encoding a mutant form of *Xenopus* α-tubulin, the T56I mutant. Injection of α-tubulin-T56I mRNA into the single-cell embryo within 30mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in 21% of tadpoles, compared to a background rate of 1% heterotaxia in controls. However, injection at 45mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in 15% of tadpoles, and at 60mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in only 10% of tadpoles. Likewise, injection into 1 of 2 cells resulted in organ heterotaxia in 6% of tadpoles and injection into 1 of 4 cells resulted in organ heterotaxia in 5% of tadpoles. Therefore the α-tubulin-T56I mutant affects laterality at a high rate within the first 30 minutes of egg fertilization but this ability is lost rapidly as the embryo develops. Craniofacial abnormalities were also present in α-tubulin-T56I-injected tadpoles. In contrast to the decrease in heterotaxia seen with later injection, craniofacial defects occurred consistently in 1-cell, 2-cell and 4-cell injections in more than 50% of tadpoles. This serves as a convenient internal positive control for the activity of the mutant tubulin protein in development. Overall, these data illustrate that the effect of α-tubulin-T56I on heterotaxia is required in the earliest timeframe of development for left-right patterning, and not at a later symmetry-breaking event, as later processes involved in craniofacial development are still affected equally regardless of the injection timepoint.",

    "text": "To place this mechanism within the known major steps of left-right patterning, we asked whether introduction of the tubulin mutant would affect the sidedness of the canonical left-side marker *Xnr1*. Injection of α-tubulin-T56I mRNA within 30mpf resulted in incorrect (right-sided, bilateral or absent) expression of *Xnr1* in 37% of neurula-stage embryos compared to 7% in uninjected controls. Therefore, transcriptional control points upstream of organ orientation are also affected by α-tubulin-T56I. Taken together, our data show that a tubulin mutation that regulates chirality in plants likewise randomizes organ laterality in *Xenopus* embryos. Moreover, the introduction of these dominant-negative mutations are only effective when performed immediately after fertilization, revealing that any tubulin-derived structures must be acting in LR patterning at very early stages of development. Disrupting microtubule regulation by post-translational modification affects laterality. Tubulins are modified by a variety of post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. The process of ubiquitylation, whereby a ubiquitin moiety is covalently fused to a protein through an electron-rich group (such as internal lysine, cysteine, serine or threonine residues, or the N-terminal amino group), can target the protein for localization to a different part of the cell or for degradation using various combinations of mono- or polyubiquitylation. The E3 ligase, Mahogunin ring-finger 1 (Mgrn1), polyubiquitylates α-tubulin to target it for degradation. *Mgrn1*-null mouse mutants exhibit phenotypes such as late-onset spongiform neurodegeneration and laterality defects such as congenital heart defects and *situs inversus*. In particular, the effect of Mgrn1 on left-right patterning was found to be uncoupled from the expression of Nodal and yet it affected laterality of downstream Nodal targets, leading the authors to conclude that Mgrn1 and tubulin ubiquitylation had a novel role in early LR patterning.",

    "text": "We show that an assortment of proteins, implicated in laterality regulation in a wide range of phyla, is capable of specifically randomizing left-right asymmetry in *Xenopus* embryos manipulated immediately post-fertilization. Neither water nor large amounts of non-specific mRNA affect laterality when injected immediately post-fertilization, demonstrating that microinjection *per se* at this early stage does not disrupt the cytoskeleton enough to affect asymmetry: the LR axis is not a highly labile system perturbed by nonspecific manipulations. Thus, the early embryo is a robust, specific assay for components required for normal LR patterning. In subsequent experiments, we scored the positioning of the 3 asymmetric organs and reported as percent heterotaxic the number of animals exhibiting aberrant situs (but normal morphology) of any of the three. We titered all reagents to levels that produced normal dorsoanterior index (DAI) phenotypes and organ morphogenesis, so that LR reversals can be interpreted cleanly without confounding effects of non-specific toxicity (and, the differences in results reported among various treatments and assays (organs vs. gene expression) were not due to differential survival). In interpreting the heterotaxia incidence percentages resulting from any of the reagents, it should be noted that the absolute highest heterotaxia level that can be observed is 87.5%: even if each organ is fully (independently) randomized, in a small percentage (12.5%) of the cases, all three organs will by chance land on their normal sides, appearing as though the animal had wild-type situs. Thus, all percentages of organ heterotaxia are relative to a ceiling that is not 100% but 87.5%.",
