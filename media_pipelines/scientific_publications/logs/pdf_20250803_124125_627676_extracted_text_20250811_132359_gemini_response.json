    "text": "A great deal is known about the formation and architecture of biological neural networks in animal models, which have arrived at their current structure-function relationship through evolution by natural selection. Little is known about the development of such structure-function relationships in a scenario where neurons are allowed to grow within evolutionarily-novel, motile bodies. Previous work showed that when a piece of ectodermal tissue is excised from Xenopus embryos and allowed to develop ex vivo, it will develop into a three-dimensional (3D) mucociliary organoid, and exhibits behaviors different from those observed in tadpoles of the same age. These 'biological robots' or 'biobots' are autonomous, self-powered, and able to move through aqueous environments. Here we report a novel type of biobot that is composed of ciliated epidermis and additionally incorporates neural tissue (neurobots). We show that neural precursor cells implanted within the Xenopus skin constructs develop into mature neurons and extend processes towards the outer surface of the bot as well as among each other. These self-organized neurobots show distinct external morphology, generate more complex patterns of spontaneous movements, and are differentially affected by neuroactive drugs compared to their non-neuronal counterparts. Calcium imaging experiments show that neurons within neurobots are indeed active. Transcriptomics analysis of the neurobots reveals increased variability of transcript profiles, expression of a plethora of genes relating to nervous system development and function, a shift toward more ancient genes, and up-regulation of neuronal genes implicated in visual perception.",

    "text": "Sensing cues from the environment and translating them into appropriate responses is the fundamental function of the nervous system in all animals. Critically, nervous systems endow animals with the ability to generate context- and experience-dependent changes in their behavior. Nervous systems are also known to be plastic and adapt both structurally and functionally, on a much shorter timescale, to changes in sensory and/or motor effectors that might occur in the lifetime of an organism, e.g. as a result of injury, amputation, or sensory deprivation, albeit in an age dependent manner. The degree to which the nervous system of an animal can adapt to a new body plan is especially impressive in cases where changes in sensory-motor architecture is particularly drastic. For example, ectopically induced eyes in the tail of Xenopus tadpoles were shown to confer light sensitivity to the eyeless hosts. What are the limits of neuroplasticity of nervous systems? How would wild-type neurons establish pattern and function in a new embodiment? Creating truly novel configurations of biological material allows us to probe the plasticity of evolutionary hardware to adapt on developmental (not evolutionary) timescales to truly novel circumstances and has applications for regenerative medicine, human augmentation, and biological engineering. We sought to establish a model system in which we could study the morphology and function of neural networks in novel scenarios, better understand the evolutionary developmental biology of the nervous system, and improve the design of future innervated constructs.",

    "text": "In the past, neuromuscular assembloids have been used to model cortico-spinal motor functions, and neural cultures have been interfaced with computers or robots using micro electrode arrays to learn and perform various tasks. These hybrid robots are not built exclusively using biological tissue, are not fully embodied, and are not self-motile. Motile biohybrid soft robots have been built mostly through engineering patterned muscle tissues and propelled through external controls, e.g. electrical or optical stimulation. Biohybrid bots that move through neuromuscular actuation have also been built by embedding neural and muscle cells in silicone polymer scaffolds. Similarly, such bots do not self-assemble, require external stimulation for propulsion, can only move at very slow speeds, have a very limited behavioral repertoire, and still require synthetic scaffolds. When ectodermal tissue is excised from the animal pole of a late blastula stage Xenopus embryo, and allowed to develop ex vivo, it will develop into a self-motile, self-powered 3D mucociliary organoid. These biobots express the four cell types normally present in a tadpole skin. These include multiciliated cells (MCCs), mucus secreting goblet cells, ionocytes that regulate ionic homeostasis of epidermis, and small secretory cells (SSCs). MCCs act as motor effectors in these organoids via flow arising from their polarized beating, generating a suite of stereotyped movement trajectories and velocities. Interestingly, SSCs were shown to secrete serotonin, which stimulates an increase in ciliary beating frequency through serotonergic receptors expressed on MCCs. These self-motile mucociliary organoids, which we will refer to herein as biobots, are capable of navigating aqueous environments, generating a suite of stereotyped movement trajectories and velocities.",

We show that neural precursor cells harvested from Xenopus embryos and implanted in biobots made from Xenopus ectodermal cells indeed differentiate into functional neurons and extend their processes within and toward the neurobot's outer surface.

    "text": "Neurobots can be constructed by implanting exogenous neural precursors into Xenopus ectodermal explants. To characterize the structure and function of a nervous system that self-assembles in a novel embodiment, we established an experimental procedure for implanting biobots with neural precursor cells during the first few minutes of their formation. As shown previously, biobots can be constructed by excising tissue from the animal hemisphere of a Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 9 Xenopus laevis embryo (animal cap). In the course of 30 minutes, the excised tissue will gradually heal, initially forming a “bowl” shape before forming a closed spherical shape. We used the time window prior to the closure of the tissue to insert neuronal precursor cells inside the healing tissue (Fig. lai, laii-top left panel). To obtain neural cells, we took advantage of the fact that if the animal cap is excised and dissociated at the late blastula to early gastrula stage, and the dissociated cells are allowed to remain separated for 3 hours or more, they will assume a neural fate. To obtain aggregates of neural precursors, we dissociated animal caps from approximately 50 embryos, allowed them to remain separated for 3 hours, reaggregated the cells, then placed clumps of reaggregated cells inside a freshly excised animal cap before it fully healed into a spherical shape (Fig. lai, laii, top left panel, see Methods). Within 30 minutes the formed composite assumes a spherical shape, and by the second day, it is fully healed (Fig. 1aii, top right panel). As with non-neuronal biobots, by the third day, multiciliated cells start appearing on their outer surface and the bots start moving around in the dish. Similar to biobots, neurobots have a lifespan of about 9-10 days without being fed, and survive by consuming maternal yolk platelet present in all early Xenopus embryonic tissue. Interestingly, by day 6 neurobots tend to have a more elongated shape than biobots, and they become significantly larger (Fig. 1b,c).",

    "text": "To investigate whether the difference in size and elongation is simply due to implanting the animal caps with additional cells, we generated a third type of bot (sham neurobots) in a manner similar to neurobots, except that the implanted cells were not allowed to remain separated for 3 hours. Instead, they were reaggregated shortly after dissociation (within 30 minutes) to prevent the induction of neural fate. We found that the sham neurobots were not elongated and did not show a significant size difference compared to biobots (Supp. Fig. 1a,b). These results suggest that the elongation and increase in size may be due to neuronal growth within neurobots. Implanted neural precursor cells differentiate into neurons, making projections within the neurobot as well as toward the cells lining the outer surface. To determine whether the implanted cells had indeed differentiated into neurons, we fixed and stained the neurobots with an antibody that specifically binds to acetylated alpha tubulin, which is abundantly present in neurons and multiciliated cells (see Methods; neurons and multiciliated cells are readily distinguishable from each other due to their distinctive morphology). We found that the implanted neural precursor cells indeed differentiate into neurons (Fig. 2). The neurons extend their processes not only within the neurobot, but also toward the outer surface (see arrows in Fig. 2c,d). Such projections toward the cells lining the surface of the bot suggest the possibility of neurons modulating the activity of surface effectors including multiciliated cells and/or the activity of those that modulate the ciliary beating frequency, e.g. small secretory cells. There was a large degree of variability in the structure of sprouting in different neurobots. No two neurobots showed identical neural architecture (Supp. Fig. 2). This is not surprising given the variability of initial conditions resulting from their manual construction and the inevitable variability of the amount of implanted tissue. This variability, however, allowed us to investigate correlations between various physical and behavioral characteristics of neurobots, which we will discuss in more detail in the following sections.",

    "text": "Despite these variabilities, we found that neural processes in most neurobots tended to emanate from one or more nuclear regions (labeled using a nuclear stain), presumably corresponding to the implanted clumps of cells (Fig. la Fig. 2c,d, Supp. Fig. 2). Interestingly, these regions were often surrounded by regions with seemingly no nuclear staining (Fig. 2b-d, Supp. Fig. 2). The presence of these seemingly empty spaces is intriguing, and we hypothesize that these spaces may be composed of neural support structures, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). Support for this hypothesis includes cases in which we observed neurites traversing long distances in this empty space along a straight line (Fig. 2b, yellow arrow). Additional support for this hypothesis comes from the significant upregulation in genes encoding various proteins associated with the ECM, which we will present later in this manuscript. Future experiments are needed to fully characterize the nature of this internal space. Neurobot neurons are functional. To assess whether neurons within neurobots are functional, we built neurobots using neural cells extracted from embryos with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GCaMP6s, see Methods); this tool is commonly used to study neural activity. Figure 3 shows an example of calcium signals measured in a freely moving neurobot, which was circling around in the dish (Supp. Video 1). Motion corrected videos (see Methods, Supp. Video 2) were then analyzed using an open-source software (suite2p) to extract the fluorescent activity. We found that the implanted cells did show calcium activity in all recorded neurobots. We occasionally observed synchronized activity in nearby or distant regions of interest, suggesting presence of connectivity among implanted neurons (see e.g. arrowheads in Fig. 3c). Measuring neural signals in freely moving neurobots however, proved to be challenging as it was not possible to keep individual regions of interest in focus over long periods of time. Moreover, since every neurobot showed a different pattern of neural expression (Supp. Fig. 2), findings in one neurobot could not be reproduced and confirmed in others. Developing methods for creating consistent neural expression and testing neurobots in experimental setups where a change in course of movement can be observed repeatedly (e.g. a maze) are critical for assessing the presence of correlations between neural activity and behavior.",

    "text": "Neurobots tend to be more active, and show an increase in their movement complexity, compared to non-neural biobots. To assess behavioral phenotypes in neurobots and investigate potential differences with non-neuronal biobots, we video recorded spontaneous movements of neurobots and biobots in small 8-well plates (n=46 neurobots and 48 biobots, Figure 4a, Supp. Video 3: single bot moving, Supp. Video 4: bots moving in 8-well plates). We used an automatic tracking software to measure the position of each bot at each video frame. Figure 4b shows the details of the 2D trajectories of the 8 neurobots depicted in panel a. There was a large degree of variability in these trajectories, with some bots moving in circular/oval trajectories with relatively constant diameter (Fig. 4b, bots #3, #8); bots that followed circular trajectories varying in diameter over time (Fig. 4b, bot #4); ones that made more complex, sometimes spirograph-like patterns (Fig. 4b, bots #1, #5, #6); those that were seemingly following the dish's boundaries (Fig. 4b, bot #7); bots that circled over very small areas (Fig. 4b, bot #2); and those that did not move at all (data not shown). Interestingly, all moving bots tended to exhibit repeating behavioral motifs. With the positional information obtained from tracking, we used custom Python code to extract 4 kinematic parameters from the bots to compare neurobots with biobots. These were total distance travelled in 30 minutes, speed, acceleration, and percentage of the well that was traversed (see Methods). We found no significant difference in the total distance traveled, the percentage of the well covered, and average speed and acceleration (Supp. Fig. 3). However, we found that the minimum movement speed of neurobots was significantly higher than that of biobots, indicating that neurobots tended to move more than biobots, remaining idle less often. To further investigate potential differences in the complexity of movement trajectories, we used a spectral analysis, calculating the power spectral density (PSD) of the trajectory time series along the X and Y coordinates (Figure 5a-b, two exemplar trajectories and their corresponding time series on the X coordinate, see Methods). We then detected significant peaks in the X and Y PSD, summed the number of unique peaks in X and Y PSDs, and defined this number as the Complexity Index (Fig. 5c). In this analysis a complexity index of one indicates a circular trajectory with constant diameter (where both X and Y PSD have one peak at the same location), and the number increases as the trajectory becomes more complex. A complexity index of zero signifies non-moving bots.",
