Consistent organ asymmetry is crucial, as disorders of laterality form an important class of birth defects. In the frog embryo, we show that: 1) in contrast to the dominant paradigm, key steps of LR asymmetry are driven by intracellular (cytoskeletal) structures, and occur shortly after fertilization; 2) left-sided genes such as Nodal are not definitive master regulators of sidedness, as errors in their expression can be corrected by subsequent developmental stages.

    "text": "Consistently-biased left-right (LR) patterning is required for the proper placement of organs including the heart and viscera. The LR axis is especially fascinating as an example of multi-scale pattern formation, since here chiral events at the subcellular level are integrated and amplified into asymmetric transcriptional cascades and ultimately into the anatomical patterning of the entire body. In contrast to the other two body axes, there is considerable controversy about the earliest mechanisms of embryonic laterality. Many molecular components of asymmetry have not been widely tested among phyla with diverse bodyplans, and it is unknown whether parallel (redundant) pathways may exist that could reverse abnormal asymmetry states at specific checkpoints in development. To address conservation of the early steps of LR patterning, we used the *Xenopus laevis* (frog) embryo to functionally test a number of protein targets known to direct asymmetry in plants, fruit fly, and rodent. Using the same reagents that randomize asymmetry in *Arabidopsis*, *Drosophila*, and mouse embryos, we show that manipulation of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton immediately post-fertilization, but not later, results in laterality defects in *Xenopus* embryos. Moreover, we observed organ-specific randomization effects and a striking dissociation of organ situs from effects on the expression of left side control genes, which parallel data from *Drosophila* and mouse. Remarkably, some early manipulations that disrupt laterality of transcriptional asymmetry determinants can be subsequently “rescued” by the embryo, resulting in normal organ situs. These data reveal the existence of novel corrective mechanisms, demonstrate that asymmetric expression of Nodal is not a definitive marker of laterality, and suggest the existence of amplification pathways that connect early cytoskeletal processes to control of organ situs bypassing Nodal. Counter to alternative models of symmetry breaking during neurulation (via ciliary structures absent in many phyla), our data suggest a widely-conserved role for the cytoskeleton in regulating left-right axis formation immediately after fertilization of the egg. The novel mechanisms that rescue organ situs, even after incorrect expression of genes previously considered to be left-side master regulators, suggest LR patterning as a new context in which to explore multi-scale redundancy and integration of patterning from the subcellular structure to the entire bodyplan.",

Loss of correct laterality can result in pathologies contributing to congenital heart disease, a common birth defect (1,2). Thus, the embryonic origin of consistent laterality is important not only for fundamental questions of evolutionary developmental biology, but also has implications for a broad class of congenital malformations (3-5). The asymmetrical positioning and orientation of organs is highly conserved (6–9), but despite much recent investigation into the molecular pathways regulating left-right axis formation, there are still many unanswered questions about conservation of early mechanisms (10–12). One model relies on cilia-driven chiral extracellular fluid flow during neurulation (13). However, one of the many difficulties with that model as a general answer to the origin of left-right patterning is that numerous phyla establish asymmetry despite lack of cilia, or do so long before cilia are formed (14–17). This includes single cells (18–21), plants (22,23), snails (24–26), nematodes (27–29), fruit flies (30–34), and even amniotes such as chicken (35–37) and pig (38).

    "text": "One of the barriers to resolving this problem is that the LR patterning roles of many specific gene products are often investigated in only one model system (39). Nevertheless, the cytoskeleton is emerging as a component that appears to be relevant to laterality in numerous phyla (23,24,28,40–44). We previously proposed the model that the intracellular cytoskeleton is an ancient, well-conserved mechanism by which embryos can, at the earliest stages of development, convert chiral molecular structures into true asymmetry of the entire bodyplan (6,16,45,46). To help unify the data from an evolutionary perspective, and test the opposing predictions of the ciliary vs. intracellular models, we asked: would the same mutations that randomize asymmetry in widely-disparate taxa, including those which do not use cilia, likewise impact asymmetry in the vertebrate *Xenopus laevis*? By microinjection of mRNA overexpressing wild type or dominant-negative mutants of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton-regulating proteins known to regulate asymmetry in very different types of bodyplans, we demonstrate that multiple components of the cytoskeleton are implicated in establishing frog laterality. Here we targeted proteins associated with microtubules and the actomyosin network, including structural proteins (α-tubulin), motor proteins (myosins), and moderators of post-translational modification of cytoskeletal components (Mgrn1, Lis1, ect2) with roles in asymmetry identified in *Arabidopsis*, *Drosophila*, and mouse. We titered all treatments to produce overall healthy embryos with normal dorsoanterior development and organ morphogenesis, and assayed the expression of laterality markers such as Nodal (*Xnr1*), *Pitx2* and *Lefty*, and the situs of the heart, gut, and gall bladder. Consistent with a very broad conservation, the same targets were implicated in generating a consistent laterality across the tree of life. Notably, effects on organ positioning of the gut observed in *Drosophila* with *Myo31DF* overexpression (47) are replicated in *Xenopus* with the frog homologue *MyolD*; and the dissociation of left-right organ positioning from Nodal expression observed in mouse mahogunin (*Mgrn1*) mutants (48) is replicated in *Xenopus*. We show that some of these steps occur very soon after fertilization and not at later stages (when cilia could be functioning).",

Indeed it had been proposed that a given species might have multiple overlapping/redundant mechanisms for establishing asymmetry (17), which could have practical consequences for approaches to biomedical disorders of laterality as well as implications for genes like Nodal as left-side \"master determinants\". Here, we show that some defects in asymmetric gene expression can be corrected at later points in development to subsequently give correct organ situs. This points to a robust mechanism for symmetry determination that occurs throughout embryogenesis and is not simply determined at a single point. Together, these data support a unified view of laterality among phyla, identify novel control points for LR patterning during embryogenesis, and suggest LR patterning as a novel paradigm for investigating pattern-correction mechanisms and the interplay of parallel pathways that integrate morphogenesis across levels of organization including the subcellular cytoskeleton, multi-cellular transcriptional domains, and the anatomy of the entire bodyplan.",

    "text": "α-tubulin and Tubgcp2, a protein of the γ-tubulin complex, are components of the microtubule cytoskeleton that affect symmetry of axial organs in *Arabidopsis* (23,40,42,64,65) and embryonic laterality in *Xenopus* (46). To determine if a mutant form of α-tubulin corresponding to a right-helical mutant which skews the direction of root growth (64) has a similar effect on vertebrate laterality as other α-tubulin mutants identified in *Arabidopsis* (46), *Xenopus laevis* embryos were microinjected with mRNA encoding a mutant form of *Xenopus* α-tubulin, the T56I mutant (Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 1, 2, Supplementary Figure 1). Injection of α-tubulin-T56I mRNA into the single-cell embryo within 30mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in 21% of tadpoles, compared to a background rate of 1% heterotaxia in controls (Figure 2A, χ²<0.001, n=286). However, injection at 45mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in 15% of tadpoles (Figure 2A, χ²<0.001 compared to controls, χ²=0.553 compared to 30mpf, n=71), and at 60mpf resulted in organ heterotaxia in only 10% of tadpoles (Figure 2A, χ²<0.001 compared to uninjected controls, χ²=0.033 compared to 30mpf, n=78). Likewise, injection into 1 of 2 cells resulted in organ heterotaxia in 6% of tadpoles (Figure 2A, χ²<0.001 compared to both uninjected controls and 30mpf, n=126) and injection into 1 of 4 cells resulted in organ heterotaxia in 5% of tadpoles (Figure 2A, χ²<0.001 compared to both uninjected controls and 30mpf, n=145). Therefore the α-tubulin-T56I mutant affects laterality at a high rate within the first 30 minutes of egg fertilization but this ability is lost rapidly as the embryo develops. Craniofacial abnormalities were also present in α-tubulin-T56I-injected tadpoles (Figure 2B). In contrast to the decrease in heterotaxia seen with later injection, craniofacial defects occurred consistently in 1-cell, 2-cell and 4-cell injections in more than 50% of tadpoles (Figure 2B). This serves as a convenient internal positive control for the activity of the mutant tubulin protein in development. Overall, these data illustrate that the effect of α-tubulin-T56I on heterotaxia is required in the earliest timeframe of development for left-right patterning, and not at a later symmetry-breaking event, as later processes involved in craniofacial development are still affected equally regardless of the injection timepoint. To place this mechanism within the known major steps of left-right patterning, we asked whether introduction of the tubulin mutant would affect the sidedness of the canonical left-side marker *Xnr1* (66,67). Injection of α-tubulin-T56I mRNA within 30mpf resulted in incorrect (right-sided, bilateral or absent) expression of *Xnr1* in 37% of neurula-stage embryos compared to 7% in uninjected controls (Figure 2C, χ²<0.001, n=183). Therefore, transcriptional control points upstream of organ orientation are also affected by α-tubulin-T56I. Taken together, our data show that a tubulin mutation that regulates chirality in plants likewise randomizes organ laterality in *Xenopus* embryos. Moreover, the introduction of these dominant-negative mutations are only effective when performed immediately after fertilization, revealing that any tubulin-derived structures must be acting in LR patterning at very early stages of development.",

Neither water nor large amounts of non-specific mRNA affect laterality when injected immediately post-fertilization, demonstrating that microinjection *per se* at this early stage does not disrupt the cytoskeleton enough to affect asymmetry: the LR axis is not a highly labile system perturbed by nonspecific manipulations. Thus, the early embryo is a robust, specific assay for components required for normal LR patterning. In subsequent experiments, we scored the positioning of the 3 asymmetric organs and reported as percent heterotaxic the number of animals exhibiting aberrant situs (but normal morphology) of any of the three. We titered all reagents to levels that produced normal dorsoanterior index (DAI) phenotypes and organ morphogenesis, so that LR reversals can be interpreted cleanly without confounding effects of non-specific toxicity (and, the differences in results reported among various treatments and assays (organs vs. gene expression) were not due to differential survival). In interpreting the heterotaxia incidence percentages resulting from any of the reagents, it should be noted that the absolute highest heterotaxia level that can be observed is 87.5%: even if each organ is fully (independently) randomized, in a small percentage (12.5%) of the cases, all three organs will by chance land on their normal sides, appearing as though the animal had wild-type situs.

Proteins and their mutations identified across kingdoms of life, from plants such as *Arabidopsis*, to invertebrates such as *Drosophila*, and to vertebrate mammals such as mouse, have all been shown to replicate their effects on laterality, and in some cases organ- and Nodal-specific phenotypes, in the frog *Xenopus laevis*. Not only is the catalogue of proteins tested capable of affecting laterality immediately post-fertilization, but individual proteins demonstrate subtle characteristics that demonstrate, and some cases replicate what is observed in other organisms, their different roles in regulating the cytoskeletal role in left-right patterning. For example, the injection of mutants of Mgrn1 demonstrated their role in affecting organ situs more than overexpression of the wild-type protein. Conversely, overexpression of wild type protein affects laterality of *Xnr1* expression more than the mutant forms (Figure 3). This matches observations of the dissociation of Nodal expression from downstream laterality in mouse (48). Especially striking is that wild-type Mgrn1 randomizes *Xnr1* expression quite effectively but has almost no effect at all on organ situs. These are the first data showing a common cytoskeletal protein involved in *Xenopus* and mouse. Similarly, the ect2 truncation mutant induced heterotaxies mostly in the gut, replicating observations for the role of the homologue Pebble in *Drosophila* (50). Observations of the Class I myosins from *Drosophila*, Myo31DF and Myo61F, were also not only confirmed in *Xenopus*, but the use of the *Xenopus* homologue to Myo31DF, Myo1d, matched exactly the role for Myo31DF in gut turning in *Drosophila* (47), whereas Myo61F, required in turning of *Drosophila* genitalia (47), was less specific in the organ situs it affected, and the *Xenopus* homologues could not affect organ situs but did affect the laterality of *Xnr1* expression (Figure 7). This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a laterality pathway component in common between *Drosophila* and vertebrates (30). It is striking that LR phenotypes in *Drosophila* and mouse are so accurately replicated in the *Xenopus* model.

    "text": "Asymmetrical positioning of organs is highly conserved (6,7,9), but a conserved mechanism for laterality is still under much discussion (10–12). One class of models, in which chiral ciliary flow provides the symmetry-breaking event, requires that multiple phyla use completely different mechanisms, be it using cilia that are all motile such as in the medaka (95); cilia that are motile and sensory cilia that are immobile, such as in zebrafish or mouse (13); or in the complete absence of the ciliated nodal structure at all, such as in chick or pig (35–38) and many invertebrates. We have discussed elsewhere the degree to which the various models of asymmetry match the available data (16,17). Our data here are consistent with prior studies (41,54,88,96,97) showing that asymmetry mechanisms function long prior to neurulation, and demonstrate that several cytoskeletal proteins randomize only when introduced extremely early. Most recently, we and other have also demonstrated that there is a conserved role for the cytoskeletal protein formin in the early establishment of chirality, in snails and frogs (26). It may be tempting to interpret some of the results via the role of cytoskeleton in cilia. However, the timing experiments with the α-tubulin mutant (Figure 2) and the myosin Flailer mutant (Figure 6) demonstrate that their disruptive function occurs immediately post-fertilization. The clear effect that the α-tubulin mutant has on a late, neural crest-derived phenotype such as craniofacial development, whilst losing its effect on laterality after 30mpf (Figure 2), clearly demonstrates its ability to target cellular chirality and not ciliary function. Even an hour later, provided with many hours of opportunity to affect ciliary processes, α-tubulin-T56I, Mgrn1-G2A and Mgrn1-C314D are not effective at randomizing asymmetry, definitively ruling out ciliary mechanisms as an explanation for the randomizing action of these particular proteins.",

    "text": "As before (Lobikin et al., 2012), we targeted different blastomeres at the 4-cell stage. Dorsal left (DL) blastomere contributes to the gastrocoel roof plate (GRP), as the GRP forms from dorsal blastomere descendants, and only cilia on the left side of the GRP are required for LR-relevant ciliary flow (98); thus, phenotypes induced by ventral right (VR) blastomere injections would be independent of any effects on ciliary flow. The original lineage analysis (98) was recently challenged with conflicting data showing that cells derived from the VR blastomere can contribute to the immotile sensory cilia (99). Regardless of which of those studies is correct, it is still the case that reagents injected into DL blastomeres are expected to affect ciliary flow at the GRP far more effectively than those injected into the VR blastomere, which is not the case for some of the reagents we tested, demonstrating how effects on asymmetry can diverge from effects predicted by the cilia models. The cytoskeleton can generate chiral information *de novo*. Self-organization of the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to generate cellular chirality (100) and chirality in single cells (18–21), plants (23), snails (24–26), nematodes (27–29), fruit flies (30–34) and frog (46). We propose that given our data linking this body of work to vertebrate development, the most parsimonious model is that of a conserved, intracellular, early origin of the LR axis, followed by subsequent elaboration events (17,45). We investigated, at the subcellular level, the changes induced in embryonic cytoskeletal dynamics by the mutant proteins that randomize organ situs (Figure 8) The data demonstrate that LR-relevant cytoskeletal molecules alter the behavior of microtubule plus ends. In future work, quantitative biophysical models of the cytoskeleton will be analyzed to understand precisely what cell properties are affected by the observed changes in plus end dynamics. Likely candidates include cells' physical properties (stiffness), motility, shape, and intracellular cargo delivery. Any of these parameters could affect downstream asymmetric gene expression and organogenesis, and multiscale models of early developmental biophysics, physiology, and transcriptional control will be built to address these questions quantitatively.",

    "text": "Our data allowed direct comparison between the degree of randomization of organ positioning vs. that observed in the expression of left-sided transcripts. While the canonical *Nodal*, *Lefty*, and *Pitx2* genes are thought to be determinants of left-sidedness, not merely markers, our results highlighted some interesting new aspects of the LR pathway. First was the observation that treatments that randomize asymmetric gene expression strongly can have much weaker effects on organ situs. This reveals that these 3 genes are not definitive readouts of an embryo's laterality, and strongly suggests that future studies must score organs as well, not only assay by *in situ* hybridization to *Nodal* and similar probes (99,101). The ability of many embryos to normalize organ locations despite incorrect asymmetric gene expression reveals the existence of a kind of self-repair or fixing checkpoint, which we have previously reported during craniofacial morphogenesis in *Xenopus* (102), and which is known to exist in a number of species (103). Future work will identify the molecular components responsible for recognizing incorrect expression of genes like *Nodal* and correcting subsequent events. The discovery of these mechanisms, and why they operate in some but not all embryos, will likely have important implications for the biomedicine of laterality-related birth defects. The dissociation between organ situs and *Nodal* expression that we observe with Mgrn1 (Figure 3) has also been observed in mouse (48). This, together with the similar outcome we showed in the class I myosins identified in *Drosophila* (Figure 7), present an interesting challenge to the assumption that expression of laterality markers such as *Nodal* correlate exactly with organ situs (Figure 9A). *Nodal* is thought to be a major instructive element in LR patterning, serving not only as a marker but being able to re-specify laterality in gain- and loss-of-function experiments (57,104–107). However, the fact that in the same batch of embryos, up to 40% of embryos may exhibit incorrect *Nodal* expression sidedness but less than 10% organ reversals with some proteins (Fig. 3A,B) while *Xnr1*, *Lefty* and *Pitx2* laterality can be closely predictive of organ situ in others (Figure 5), suggests that *Nodal* signaling is not necessarily a definitive determinant of final morphological outcome. This has been noted in other pathways in multiple model systems (49) and the absent *Nodal* expression in embryos that grow up to be normal (7% of control embryos show no expression of *Xnrl*, e.g. Figure 2C) that we have observed previously (see Figure 7 in (54)) underscores that *Nodal* is not a definitive marker of laterality.; these data suggest that *Nodal* expression is not a sufficient readout of laterality outcome for some perturbations, its predictive value is not high.",
