    "text": "A great deal is known about the formation and architecture of biological neural networks in animal models, which have arrived at their current structure-function relationship through evolution by natural selection. Little is known about the development of such structure-function relationships in a scenario where neurons are allowed to grow within evolutionarily-novel, motile bodies. Previous work showed that when a piece of ectodermal tissue is excised from Xenopus embryos and allowed to develop ex vivo, it will develop into a three-dimensional (3D) mucociliary organoid, and exhibits behaviors different from those observed in tadpoles of the same age. These 'biological robots' or 'biobots' are autonomous, self-powered, and able to move through aqueous environments. Here we report a novel type of biobot that is composed of ciliated epidermis and additionally incorporates neural tissue (neurobots). We show that neural precursor cells implanted within the Xenopus skin constructs develop into mature neurons and extend processes towards the outer surface of the bot as well as among each other. These self-organized neurobots show distinct external morphology, generate more complex patterns of spontaneous movements, and are differentially affected by neuroactive drugs compared to their non-neuronal counterparts. Calcium imaging experiments show that neurons within neurobots are indeed active. Transcriptomics analysis of the neurobots reveals increased variability of transcript profiles, expression of a plethora of genes relating to nervous system development and function, a shift toward more ancient genes, and up-regulation of neuronal genes implicated in visual perception.",

    "text": "Sensing cues from the environment and translating them into appropriate responses is the fundamental function of the nervous system in all animals. Critically, nervous systems endow animals with the ability to generate context- and experience-dependent changes in their behavior. Nervous systems are also known to be plastic and adapt both structurally and functionally, on a much shorter timescale, to changes in sensory and/or motor effectors that might occur in the lifetime of an organism, e.g. as a result of injury, amputation, or sensory deprivation, albeit in an age dependent manner. The degree to which the nervous system of an animal can adapt to a new body plan is especially impressive in cases where changes in sensory-motor architecture is particularly drastic. For example, ectopically induced eyes in the tail of Xenopus tadpoles were shown to confer light sensitivity to the eyeless hosts. What are the limits of neuroplasticity of nervous systems? How would wild-type neurons establish pattern and function in a new embodiment? Creating truly novel configurations of biological material allows us to probe the plasticity of evolutionary hardware to adapt on developmental (not evolutionary) timescales to truly novel circumstances and has applications for regenerative medicine, human augmentation, and biological engineering. We sought to establish a model system in which we could study the morphology and function of neural networks in novel scenarios, better understand the evolutionary developmental biology of the nervous system, and improve the design of future innervated constructs.",

    "text": "In the past, neuromuscular assembloids have been used to model cortico-spinal motor functions, and neural cultures have been interfaced with computers or robots using micro electrode arrays to learn and perform various tasks. These hybrid robots are not built exclusively using biological tissue, are not fully embodied, and are not self-motile. Motile biohybrid soft robots have been built mostly through engineering patterned muscle tissues and propelled through external controls, e.g. electrical or optical stimulation. Biohybrid bots that move through neuromuscular actuation have also been built by embedding neural and muscle cells in silicone polymer scaffolds. Similarly, such bots do not self-assemble, require external stimulation for propulsion, can only move at very slow speeds, have a very limited behavioral repertoire, and still require synthetic scaffolds. When ectodermal tissue is excised from the animal pole of a late blastula stage Xenopus embryo, and allowed to develop ex vivo, it will develop into a self-motile, self-powered 3D mucociliary organoid. These biobots express the four cell types normally present in a tadpole skin. These include multiciliated cells (MCCs), mucus secreting goblet cells, ionocytes that regulate ionic homeostasis of epidermis, and small secretory cells (SSCs). MCCs act as motor effectors in these organoids via flow arising from their polarized beating, generating a suite of stereotyped movement trajectories and velocities. Interestingly, SSCs were shown to secrete serotonin, which stimulates an increase in ciliary beating frequency through serotonergic receptors expressed on MCCs. These self-motile mucociliary organoids, which we will refer to herein as biobots, are capable of navigating aqueous environments, generating a suite of stereotyped movement trajectories and velocities.",

    "text": "Neurobots can be constructed by implanting exogenous neural precursors into Xenopus ectodermal explants. To characterize the structure and function of a nervous system that self-assembles in a novel embodiment, we established an experimental procedure for implanting biobots with neural precursor cells during the first few minutes of their formation. As shown previously, biobots can be constructed by excising tissue from the animal hemisphere of a Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 9 Xenopus laevis embryo (animal cap). In the course of 30 minutes, the excised tissue will gradually heal, initially forming a “bowl” shape before forming a closed spherical shape. We used the time window prior to the closure of the tissue to insert neuronal precursor cells inside the healing tissue (Fig. lai, laii-top left panel). To obtain neural cells, we took advantage of the fact that if the animal cap is excised and dissociated at the late blastula to early gastrula stage, and the dissociated cells are allowed to remain separated for 3 hours or more, they will assume a neural fate. To obtain aggregates of neural precursors, we dissociated animal caps from approximately 50 embryos, allowed them to remain separated for 3 hours, reaggregated the cells, then placed clumps of reaggregated cells inside a freshly excised animal cap before it fully healed into a spherical shape (Fig. lai, laii, top left panel, see Methods). Within 30 minutes the formed composite assumes a spherical shape, and by the second day, it is fully healed (Fig. 1aii, top right panel). As with non-neuronal biobots, by the third day, multiciliated cells start appearing on their outer surface and the bots start moving around in the dish. Similar to biobots, neurobots have a lifespan of about 9-10 days without being fed, and survive by consuming maternal yolk platelet present in all early Xenopus embryonic tissue. Interestingly, by day 6 neurobots tend to have a more elongated shape than biobots, and they become significantly larger (Fig. 1b,c).",

    "text": "To investigate whether the difference in size and elongation is simply due to implanting the animal caps with additional cells, we generated a third type of bot (sham neurobots) in a manner similar to neurobots, except that the implanted cells were not allowed to remain separated for 3 hours. Instead, they were reaggregated shortly after dissociation (within 30 minutes) to prevent the induction of neural fate. We found that the sham neurobots were not elongated and did not show a significant size difference compared to biobots (Supp. Fig. 1a,b). These results suggest that the elongation and increase in size may be due to neuronal growth within neurobots. Implanted neural precursor cells differentiate into neurons, making projections within the neurobot as well as toward the cells lining the outer surface. To determine whether the implanted cells had indeed differentiated into neurons, we fixed and stained the neurobots with an antibody that specifically binds to acetylated alpha tubulin, which is abundantly present in neurons and multiciliated cells (see Methods; neurons and multiciliated cells are readily distinguishable from each other due to their distinctive morphology). We found that the implanted neural precursor cells indeed differentiate into neurons (Fig. 2). The neurons extend their processes not only within the neurobot, but also toward the outer surface (see arrows in Fig. 2c,d). Such projections toward the cells lining the surface of the bot suggest the possibility of neurons modulating the activity of surface effectors including multiciliated cells and/or the activity of those that modulate the ciliary beating frequency, e.g. small secretory cells. There was a large degree of variability in the structure of sprouting in different neurobots. No two neurobots showed identical neural architecture (Supp. Fig. 2). This is not surprising given the variability of initial conditions resulting from their manual construction and the inevitable variability of the amount of implanted tissue. This variability, however, allowed us to investigate correlations between various physical and behavioral characteristics of neurobots, which we will discuss in more detail in the following sections.",

    "text": "Despite these variabilities, we found that neural processes in most neurobots tended to emanate from one or more nuclear regions (labeled using a nuclear stain), presumably corresponding to the implanted clumps of cells (Fig. la Fig. 2c,d, Supp. Fig. 2). Interestingly, these regions were often surrounded by regions with seemingly no nuclear staining (Fig. 2b-d, Supp. Fig. 2). The presence of these seemingly empty spaces is intriguing, and we hypothesize that these spaces may be composed of neural support structures, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). Support for this hypothesis includes cases in which we observed neurites traversing long distances in this empty space along a straight line (Fig. 2b, yellow arrow). Additional support for this hypothesis comes from the significant upregulation in genes encoding various proteins associated with the ECM, which we will present later in this manuscript. Future experiments are needed to fully characterize the nature of this internal space. Neurobot neurons are functional. To assess whether neurons within neurobots are functional, we built neurobots using neural cells extracted from embryos with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GCaMP6s, see Methods); this tool is commonly used to study neural activity. Figure 3 shows an example of calcium signals measured in a freely moving neurobot, which was circling around in the dish (Supp. Video 1). Motion corrected videos (see Methods, Supp. Video 2) were then analyzed using an open-source software (suite2p) to extract the fluorescent activity. We found that the implanted cells did show calcium activity in all recorded neurobots. We occasionally observed synchronized activity in nearby or distant regions of interest, suggesting presence of connectivity among implanted neurons (see e.g. arrowheads in Fig. 3c). Measuring neural signals in freely moving neurobots however, proved to be challenging as it was not possible to keep individual regions of interest in focus over long periods of time. Moreover, since every neurobot showed a different pattern of neural expression (Supp. Fig. 2), findings in one neurobot could not be reproduced and confirmed in others. Developing methods for creating consistent neural expression and testing neurobots in experimental setups where a change in course of movement can be observed repeatedly (e.g. a maze) are critical for assessing the presence of correlations between neural activity and behavior.",

    "text": "Neurobots tend to be more active, and show an increase in their movement complexity, compared to non-neural biobots. To assess behavioral phenotypes in neurobots and investigate potential differences with non-neuronal biobots, we video recorded spontaneous movements of neurobots and biobots in small 8-well plates (n=46 neurobots and 48 biobots, Figure 4a, Supp. Video 3: single bot moving, Supp. Video 4: bots moving in 8-well plates). We used an automatic tracking software to measure the position of each bot at each video frame. Figure 4b shows the details of the 2D trajectories of the 8 neurobots depicted in panel a. There was a large degree of variability in these trajectories, with some bots moving in circular/oval trajectories with relatively constant diameter (Fig. 4b, bots #3, #8); bots that followed circular trajectories varying in diameter over time (Fig. 4b, bot #4); ones that made more complex, sometimes spirograph-like patterns (Fig. 4b, bots #1, #5, #6); those that were seemingly following the dish's boundaries (Fig. 4b, bot #7); bots that circled over very small areas (Fig. 4b, bot #2); and those that did not move at all (data not shown). Interestingly, all moving bots tended to exhibit repeating behavioral motifs. With the positional information obtained from tracking, we used custom Python code to extract 4 kinematic parameters from the bots to compare neurobots with biobots. These were total distance travelled in 30 minutes, speed, acceleration, and percentage of the well that was traversed (see Methods). We found no significant difference in the total distance traveled, the percentage of the well covered, and average speed and acceleration (Supp. Fig. 3). However, we found that the minimum movement speed of neurobots was significantly higher than that of biobots, indicating that neurobots tended to move more than biobots, remaining idle less often.",

We then detected significant peaks in the X and Y PSD, summed the number of unique peaks in X and Y PSDs, and defined this number as the Complexity Index (Fig. 5c). In this analysis a complexity index of one indicates a circular trajectory with constant diameter (where both X and Y PSD have one peak at the same location), and the number increases as the trajectory becomes more complex. A complexity index of zero signifies non-moving bots. Interestingly, we found that neurobots showed a significantly higher degree of trajectory complexity compared to biobots (Fig. 6a). This increased complexity could not be explained by the roundness or size of the biobots and neurobots as these variables were not significantly correlated (Fig. 6b,c, correlation coefficient (CI, Area)=-0.03, p=0.76 and correlation coefficient (CI, RI)=-0.15, p=0.2). The increased complexity of biobots could be a result of increased variability in the beating frequency of cilia in MCCs, changes in their spatial distribution, changes in the 3D structure of the bot, or changes in the activity or distribution of other cell types (including neurons) that may modulate the ciliary beating frequency, or for other reasons. When we measured this index in sham neurobots, however, we also found an increase, albeit not significant, relative to biobots (Supp. Fig1-c), indicating that the increased complexity we observe in neurobots is at least partially due to factors other than neural signaling. Like biobots, sham neurobots were more likely to show longer periods of immobility, and their minimum speeds were not significantly different from that of biobots (Supp. Fig1-d). Finally, consistent with the finding that minimum speed was significantly higher in neurobots (Fig. 6d), we found that most inactive bots (Npeaks=0) were in the biobot category, with 6 out of 48 (12.5%) biobots inactive, whereas only one out of 47 (2.1%) neurobots were inactive.",

    "text": "A seizure-inducing drug differentially affects behavior of neurobots and biobots. To further investigate whether neural activity could play a role in modulating trajectory complexity, we performed pharmacological experiments, treating groups of neurobots and biobots with pentylentetrazol (PTZ), a GABAĀ receptor antagonist used for its seizure-inducing effects in animal studies. Although we do not know the identity of neuronal constituents of neurobots, we reasoned that a positive result, e.g. an increase in the complexity index after PTZ treatment, could be an indirect indication of presence of GABAergic control of movement. To test this, we performed experiments in which we video recorded the movement of neurobots and biobots in regular media and compared the complexity indices after they were transferred to dishes containing 15 mM PTZ. To get an estimate on the baseline complexity index and account for potential variability due the transferring, we followed the experimental protocol depicted in Figure 7a. Behavior of bots (16 neurobots and 16 biobots) was video recorded for 30 minutes in 8-well plates filled with regular media (control 1), after which the bots were transferred to the second and third sets of dishes containing regular media (control 2, control 3). The bots were then transferred to dishes containing PTZ (Fig. 7a). For each bot, we calculated the CIs for the three control conditions and used the average to calculate relative complexity measures for PTZ and the wash. We found that all except two biobots showed a relative decline in their movement complexity while in PTZ (Fig. 7b), thereby significantly reducing the CI relative to control (T test, p=0.009). On the other hand, the majority of neurobots showed increased complexity relative to control, although a few did show a decline (Fig. 7b). As a result of this dichotomy in the impact of PTZ, the average CI in neurobots was not significantly different relative to control (T test, p= 0.39). When we compared the relative complexity after PTZ treatment, however, we found a significant difference between neurobots and biobots, with neurobots showing significantly higher values for relative complexity (Fig. 7c). The variability of the impact of PTZ on neurobots is in fact not surprising given the potential variability in the identity and the degree of expression of neurons (Supp. Fig. 2). What is very interesting is the significant differential impact on the biobots and neurobots. Because neurobots are biobots + neurons, the fact that most of them showed an increase in their CI suggests a role for neural activity acting against the default inhibitory effect of PTZ on the movement of biobots. Alternatively, neural expression could indirectly contribute to these effects through its impact on the expression of MCCs or other cell types present on the outer surface of the bots.",

    "text": "Neurobots show significant differences in the distribution of MCCs, and their roundness is anti-correlated with the degree of neural expression. To quantify the overall amount of neural expression and its relationship with neurobot morphology and behavior, we used the confocal images of neurobots immunostained with acetylated alpha tubulin antibody, which labels neurons and cilia in the MCCs. Using this data, we traced the neural processes, and quantified the position of the MCCs using Imaris software (Fig. 8a,b, see Methods). In this analysis, we did not distinguish between axons or dendrites and could not determine whether these processes belonged to individual neurons. We could, however, obtain rough estimates of the total amount of neural tissue and the degree of branching by calculating the total length of neurites and the number of terminals, which were defined as the number of nerve endings, agnostic of their identity (i.e. axonal or dendritic). Figure 8a,b shows two examples of such traces in cases of neurobots with very few and many neurites. We calculated the correlation between the degree of sprouting, expression of MCCs, bot size and shape, as well as the CI of the trajectories across all neurobots for which we had both behavioral and structural data (Fig.8c). We also calculated the correlation of all these parameters with the relative amount of neural tissue that was implanted on Day 1 as the neurobots were constructed. This ratio was calculated by dividing the area of the implanted clumps by that of the external shell (Fig. 8c: Neu/Ect, Fig. 1aii, see Methods). Based on this analysis we found that the total number of neuron terminals was highly correlated with both absolute and area-normalized neural length (neurite density). Interestingly, we found a significant negative correlation between neurite density and MCC expression density; neurobots with higher neurite density tended to have lower overall density of MCCs. Consistent with this finding, we found that biobots (which do not have neurons) have a significantly higher density of MCCs compared to neurobots (Supp. Fig 4). Additionally, we found a significant negative correlation between the Roundness Index (RI) and neurites' absolute length, neurites' normalized length, and total number of terminals. That is, the more elongated the bot, the more neural expression, suggesting that the elongation could be a result of neural processes growing within the neurobot. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that sham neurobots were not different from biobots in their roundness index (Supp. Fig. 1a). We did not however, find a significant correlation between CI and neural expression although the neurobot with highest complexity index also had the largest number of terminals and neurite length (see the outlier data point in the panels). Similarly, we found only a small correlation (non-significant) between the relative amount of implanted tissue and the degree of neural expression.",

We investigated whether this treatment would have an impact on the degree of neural sprouting in neurobots, where the neurons are all ectopic. Interestingly, we found that this treatment increased the degree of neural expression in neurobots as well, although it did not have a significant effect on any of the behavioral measurements including trajectory complexity (Supp. Fig. 5). In this group we found a tight correlation between the ratio of neural implant to ectoderm shell and total number of terminals, as well as total neural length (Supp. Fig. 5). These results indicate that neurons in a neurobot behave as ectopic, not native, cells. Notably, 4 of the 16 neurobots in the PTZ study presented in the previous section were cultured in zolmitriptan (filled circles Fig. 7b, Supp. Fig. 5), three of which showed an increase in relative complexity. This result points to the possibility that this treatment may bias neural expression towards those that respond to PTZ i.e. GABAergic neurons. Further experiments are required to characterize the impact of zolmitriptan treatment on the neural expression patterns within neurobots. In summary, neural growth in neurobots significantly impacts their shape and the distribution of MCCs, and this growth could be potentially increased by modulating serotonergic signaling. The degree to which neural expression contributes to trajectory complexity remains elusive. The lack of observed correlation between neurite growth and complexity index points to the potential heterogeneities in cell type expression and connectivity profiles of neurites across neurobots.",

    "text": "The three types of bots exhibit significantly different patterns of gene expression. Like CNS structure and function, transcriptomes are usually thought of as being shaped by a long history of selection. In standard organisms, they are also shaped by neural inputs. What would the transcriptome of a novel construct with a nervous system look like? With this question in mind, we next asked what changes to default biobot transcriptomes, if any, would be induced by the presence of neural tissue. To characterize the transcriptome of neurobots and compare it to its non-neuronal counterparts (i.e. biobots and sham neurobots), we performed bulk RNA sequencing of their tissue. For each bot type four biological samples were included (neurobots: NB1-4, biobots: BB1-4, sham neurobots: SH1-4). Due to the small size of the bots, and therefore, small amount of RNA, each sample comprised tissue from multiple bots (see Methods). We found a high degree of correlation between normalized gene expression levels among all samples within each group (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced, FPKM), indicating reliability and repeatability of the results (Fig. 9a). Moreover, we found that gene expression levels in biobots and sham neurobots were much more correlated to one another than to neurobots (Fig. 9a, see Methods). Similarly, neurobots could clearly be separated from shams and biobots based on the principal component analysis on the normalized gene expression value (FPKM) of all samples (Fig. 9b, see Methods). We next compared the gene count variability across the samples of biobots, neurobots, and sham neurobots on a gene-by-gene basis (Fig. 9c-f). We found that neurobots showed a significantly higher variability, quantified by coefficient of variation (CV, see Methods) in their normalized gene counts (FPKM) across neurobot samples, compared to both biobots and shams, and samples of sham neurobots showed a higher variability compared to samples of biobots (Fig. 9c). We then compared pairs of groups (e.g., NB and BB) to determine the fraction of genes that had a greater CV in normalized gene count in one group than the same gene in the other group. For the chosen pair of groups, genes were ranked by the mean count value across all pools of both groups, and the CV of each gene's counts across the pools of each group was calculated (Supp. Fig. 9, see Methods). The CV list was split into 100 bins (percentiles) containing equal number of genes, and the fraction of genes in the bin for which the CV of the first group was greater than that of the second group was found and plotted.",

For the sham neurobot group, genes in most, but not all bins showed higher CV compared to biobots (Fig. 9c). In addition, we found a trend for genes with higher normalized counts showing a higher degree of variability in their expression when comparing neurobots with biobots and shams (Fig. 9d,f). This pattern was significantly different from what is expected from chance in most bins (dark blue bins), i.e. relative to the average CV calculated across all bins regardless of the order (orange line, see Methods). The overall higher variability seen in neurobots and shams compared to biobots could be due to several factors. First, in both neurobots and shams, the implanted cells are harvested from ~50 embryos, whereas a biobot is made out of a single embryo. Moreover, higher variability in the implanted bots is expected due to the high variability in the size of the implants in both neurobots and shams. However, these are likely not the only factors involved, as neurobots showed significant differences in their gene count variability compared to shams. Neural differentiation, therefore, likely plays an important role in the increased variability in gene counts seen in neurobots. Additionally, we found that neurobots included a significantly larger number of genes that were differentially expressed relative to biobots and sham neurobots (Fig. 10 a,b), whereas biobots exhibited a smaller subset of differentially expressed genes relative to sham neurobots (Fig. 10c). Moreover, the number of significantly upregulated genes (p<0.05, red dots with positive fold change) in neurobots compared to biobots and shams (6774 and 6859 genes, respectively), were much higher than those that were significantly downregulated (red dots with negative log fold change, 3578 in neurobots vs biobots and 4010 in neurobots vs shams), resulting in highly asymmetric volcano plots (Fig. 10 a,b).

    "text": "We next investigated which biological functions or pathways are significantly associated with the differentially expressed genes. We used Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to annotate genes to biological processes (bp), molecular function (mf) and cellular components (cc). Due to the large number of upregulated genes in neurobots, we focused on the highly overexpressed genes (4 log-fold or more increase in expression, 2445 genes when comparing neurobots to biobots and 2026 genes when comparing neurobots to shams) for this analysis. The most significantly upregulated pathways in neurobots relative to biobots, as well as in neurobots relative to shams, related to nervous system development, and synapse and neuron projection (Fig. 11 a,b). One of the interesting genes we found up-regulated specifically in neurobots relative to biobots and shams is Dact-4, a member of an evolutionarily conserved family of Dishevelled-binding proteins involved in the regulation of Wnt and TGF-beta signaling which is expressed in the Spemann organizer. This suggests that the presence of neurons might exert an organizational influence on the surrounding soma; this molecular signature is consistent with known roles of the nervous system to direct cell behavior in cancer suppression, regeneration, and embryonic morphogenesis. Trans-synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter receptor activity were also significantly upregulated in neurobots. This included glutamatergic, GABAergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glycinergic receptors. Surprisingly, exclusively in neurobots, we also found significant enrichment in pathways involved in visual perception (Fig. 11a). Although pathways relating to neuron projection and trans-synaptic signaling were slightly upregulated in sham neurobots compared to biobots, there were far fewer genes in each pathway, and they were less significant in their degree of upregulation compared to those in neurobots (Supp Fig. 6a). Further, there were relatively fewer genes downregulated when comparing neurobots with biobots, and shams (63 and 116 genes respectively) and very few genes were significantly downregulated by 4-log folds when comparing shams with biobots (38 genes). Our enrichment analysis showed that the largest group of downregulated genes in neurobots compared to biobots belonged to the cellular component pathway (extracellular region in Supp. Fig. 6b). Interestingly, this pathway includes some of the genes expressed in the Xenopus skin, including glycoprotein 2 (gp2), and mucin (muc17) suggesting that the properties of the ‘skin' of neurobots might be different from those of biobots.",
