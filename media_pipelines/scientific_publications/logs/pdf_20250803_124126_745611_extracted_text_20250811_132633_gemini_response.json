    "text": "Biological methylation, using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), produces S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent methylation inhibitor. SAH hydrolase (SAHH) is crucial for metabolizing SAH, maintaining methylation-permissive conditions, and facilitating metabolite recycling. Changes in SAH and homocysteine levels are linked to human diseases like Alzheimer's and cardiovascular issues. Planarian flatworms, with their metabolic flexibility and ability to regenerate, are used as a model to study SAHH's role in homeostasis.",
