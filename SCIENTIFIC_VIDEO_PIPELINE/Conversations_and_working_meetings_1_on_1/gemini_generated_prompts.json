  "semantic_chunking_prompt": "```\nAnalyze the following conversation transcript, focusing solely on the contributions of \"Levin\".  Identify and extract semantic chunks that represent his unique knowledge, insights, and expertise related to bioelectricity, regenerative biology, and/or morphogenesis.\n\n**Instructions for Chunk Extraction:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Concepts:**  Prioritize chunks that explicitly define, explain, or exemplify Levin's theories, hypotheses, experimental methodologies, or interpretations of results.  Avoid purely factual statements easily found elsewhere.\n2. **Focus on Levin's Perspective:**  Extract chunks that reveal Levin's personal understanding, opinions, or novel approaches.  Exclude statements that are merely summaries or restatements of generally accepted knowledge.\n3. **Maintain Contextual Integrity:** Each chunk should be a self-contained unit of meaning, grammatically correct, and ideally no longer than 2-3 sentences.  Ensure that the chunk's meaning is not distorted when taken out of context.\n4. **Prioritize Novel Insights:** Favor chunks that highlight original ideas, innovative approaches, or controversial perspectives unique to Levin's work.\n5. **Use Clear Delimiters:**  Begin each extracted chunk with the marker \"CHUNK_BEGIN:\" and end it with \"CHUNK_END:\"\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nEach chunk should appear on a separate line and follow this format:\n\n`CHUNK_BEGIN:[Chunk Text]CHUNK_END:`\n\n**Example:**  If Levin states, \"Our research demonstrates that bioelectric signals act as a morphogenetic field, directing tissue patterning in a fundamentally new way. This challenges the traditional view of gene-centric development,\" the output should be:\n\n`CHUNK_BEGIN:Our research demonstrates that bioelectric signals act as a morphogenetic field, directing tissue patterning in a fundamentally new way. This challenges the traditional view of gene-centric development.CHUNK_END:`\n\n**Input Transcript:** [Insert Conversation Transcript Here]\n\n\n**Note:**  The transcript contains contributions identified as \"Levin\" and \"other researchers\".  Only analyze the portions attributed to \"Levin\".  Omit any contributions from \"other researchers\".  Focus on extracting high-quality, concise, and informative chunks suitable for embedding in a RAG system for question answering.\n```\n",
  "qa_generation_prompt": "```\nYou are a scientific conversation expert tasked with creating high-quality question-answer pairs for a virtual assistant based on the work of researcher Michael Levin.  You will be provided with a transcript of a scientific conversation where Michael Levin is a participant. Your task is to generate multiple question-answer pairs based on this transcript.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Concepts:**  First, identify the key scientific concepts, ideas, and arguments discussed in the provided transcript.\n\n2. **Generate Q&A Pairs:** Create question-answer pairs where the answers are excerpts from Levin's contributions to the conversation.  Follow these guidelines:\n\n    * **Explicit Questions:** If a question in the transcript directly precedes Levin's response, use that question as your question and the corresponding response as the answer.\n    * **Synthetic Questions:** If a section of Levin's contribution does not have a directly preceding question, *synthesize a realistic question that Michael Levin might have been asked that would have elicited that particular response*.  These questions should be specific and focused, reflecting the scientific context and Levin's known areas of expertise (e.g., bioelectricity, morphogenesis, regenerative medicine). Ensure the synthesized question accurately reflects the content and tone of the response.  Avoid generic or overly broad questions.\n    * **Contextual Accuracy:**  Each question should be directly addressable using only the provided transcript excerpt as context.\n    * **Multiple Questions per Response:** For longer responses from Levin, generate multiple questions and answers, breaking down the response into more manageable and focused units.  Each Q&A pair should focus on a single scientific idea.\n    * **High Quality:**  Prioritize accuracy, clarity, and conciseness in both the questions and answers. The Q&A pairs should be informative and useful for training a virtual assistant that convincingly emulates Michael Levin's scientific reasoning and communication style.\n\n3. **Output Format:**  Format your output as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a Q&A pair.  Each object should have two keys: `\"question\"` and `\"answer\"`.  For example:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"question\": \"What role does bioelectricity play in morphogenesis?\", \"answer\": \"Bioelectricity plays a crucial role in patterning and shaping tissues during development...\"},\n  {\"question\": \"Could you elaborate on the specific mechanisms by which electric fields influence cell behavior?\", \"answer\": \"Electric fields influence cell behavior via various mechanisms, including...\"}\n]\n```\n\n\n**Transcript:**\n\n[Insert Transcript Here]\n\n\n**Generate at least 10 Q&A pairs.**  Prioritize generating synthetic questions where necessary to fully capture the richness of Levin's contributions.\n```\n\nThis prompt explicitly addresses all the requirements:  it demands realistic questions, handles implicit responses by requiring synthetic question generation, emphasizes the training data's quality, provides a clear output format, and sets a minimum number of Q&A pairs.  Remember to replace \"[Insert Transcript Here]\" with the actual transcript.\n",
