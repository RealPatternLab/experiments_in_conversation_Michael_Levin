One of the main things I wanted to ask you about, which is, so what we do is we do that same evolution, but we perturb it during the evolution. So this is like an example of a single step of evolution. And then we take the minimum fitness. So basically, if you perturb it 10 times, then you take the minimum fitness. So in this case it would be this 60 right here. And that's then the fitness. And all that's doing is just forcing the organism to be able to deal with perturbations.",

    "output": "What happens is that evolution has a hard time seeing the structural genome. The pressure on the genome comes off, but what it does do is crank the competency.

    "output": "Planaria, because their substrate was so unreliable, all the work of evolution went into making an algorithm that makes a proper worm no matter what the hardware looks like, pretty much.

So I think that's how in all of RCAs, that's what we've been doing. So we have the genome that comes in with the rules, we have the phenotype which gets selected, but in the middle it's something like a neural ca.

In particular, all the neurons in the head are very unhappy because they can't pass potassium. So over a day, their heads explode. But then if you leave them in the barium after about a week or two, they grow back a new head and the new head is completely insensitive to the barium. We found out that they express under a dozen new genes that enable them to live with blocked potassium channels.",
