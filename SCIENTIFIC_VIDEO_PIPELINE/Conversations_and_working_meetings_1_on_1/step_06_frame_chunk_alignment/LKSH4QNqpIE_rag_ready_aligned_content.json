One of the main things I wanted to ask you about, which is, so what we do is we do that same evolution, but we perturb it during the evolution. So this is like an example of a single step of evolution. And then we take the minimum fitness. So basically, if you perturb it 10 times, then you take the minimum fitness. So in this case it would be this 60 right here. And that's then the fitness. And all that's doing is just forcing the organism to be able to deal with perturbations.",

So they're kind of the biggest example of that's why there are no mutant lines is because, yeah, you try to edit the genome, but they ignore it because they mostly ignore their own genome too.",

    "question": "How do planaria demonstrate creative problem-solving in response to environmental challenges?",
    "answer": "In planaria, for example, we have this thing where we put them in barium chloride and barium is a non-specific blocker of potassium channels. So the cells are very unhappy. In particular, all the neurons in the head are very unhappy because they can't pass potassium. So over a day, their heads explode. But then if you leave them in the barium after about a week or two, they grow back a new head and the new head is completely insensitive to the barium. We found out that they express under a dozen new genes that enable them to live with blocked potassium channels.",

    "question": "How do biological systems find novel solutions to environmental challenges?",
    "answer": "The living material is able to achieve the standard outcome despite all the noise and unreliability of the substrate, but also find new solutions, whether they be physiological solutions like vivarium or anatomical solutions and behavioral solutions like for anthrobots and xenobots. There's some degree of homeostasis and navigation of that anatomical space, but also towards novel solutions, which I think is just the exact same thing as creative problem-solving.",
