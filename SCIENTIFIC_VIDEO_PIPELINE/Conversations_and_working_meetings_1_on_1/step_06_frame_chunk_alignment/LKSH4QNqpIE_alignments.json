One of the main things I wanted to ask you about, which is, so what we do is we do that same evolution, but we perturb it during the evolution. So this is like an example of a single step of evolution. And then we take the minimum fitness. So basically, if you perturb it 10 times, then you take the minimum fitness. So in this case it would be this 60 right here. And that's then the fitness. And all that's doing is just forcing the organism to be able to deal with perturbations.",
