Actually, at this website, you can download all of the data sets, the software, the control, everything is here. And then this is my own sort of personal thoughts about what this all means. So I want to start here with this classic piece of art called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden. And this is a worldview that, even for people who are not overtly religious, this is, I think, really a worldview that permeates modern science. And it's the idea that there are these distinct categorical species. They're all different from each other, they're innumerable. We know what they are. And then Adam over here is different. This, I think we're going to have to blow up. And I'll show you the ways in which we sort of dissolve that.",

First of all, it allowed us to understand that things that we think of as quite different are actually the same thing. They are different expressions of the same underlying dynamics. So an incredibly powerful unification. And then it allowed us to build technologies and to realize that while we are directly only sensitive here, that's just a contingent fact of our evolutionary history. In fact, with tools, with the right equipment, we are now we can become sensitive to all of this stuff. And of course there are many applications. And so, and so this is what I'm really interested, I'm really interested in creating tools, conceptual tools, but and also practical bench tools. Because the implications of the work that I'm describing here have very practical kinds of effects on things like birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer medicine, bioengineering, and so on. What we want are tools that allow us to see across the spectrum of minds, that is to fight the kind of mind blindness that we have by default.

Okay? So we know from developmental biology that there is no special magical point where these things kick in and you become a mind, as opposed to previously being just physics. And so this is what we need to understand. We need to understand the scaling of this of mind as it goes from these kinds of very simple things to something much more complex. By the way, there are some other paths along this journey, so I won't have time to talk about it today, but if anybody wants to ask me, we can discuss what happens later in terms of a dissociative identity disorder of your body, which is basically cancer. And there are some other even weirder things that can happen, which I will describe in a moment where your cells can have an entirely new life even after the death of the original human donor as anthrobots. And we'll talk about that. And the key to this is that the key to understanding this process is that very differently from how we build our computers and robots. And we can talk about as well, if somebody wants to ask what the differences actually are. There are some really interesting differences. We are made of an agential material.

It only cares about things with a very short spatiotemporal horizon. But put together, they can form much greater things. And of course, by the way, a lot of folks will say that, well, okay, so you're saying that intelligence goes down to the single cell level. I mean, that's weird enough, but actually it's well below that, because even the molecular networks inside of cells, never mind the cell itself, but just, just the molecular networks already have six different kinds of learning they can do, including Pavlovian conditioning. And they have. If you're interested in things like causal information theory and Tononi's models of, of phi and integrated information that some people think is associated with consciousness, those already exist here at the molecular network level. Inside of that cell, the material, the tiniest material, already has aspects of learning and integrated information. And we're making use of that by developing applications in drug conditioning and things like that to train these pathways. Nevermind the animal, nevermind the cells, but the actual molecular pathways inside. And so our bodies have this amazing nested intelligence.

It doesn't say what problem space you're operating with. It just says you have a capacity to navigate that space in a way to solve problems. The very first problem that the collective has to solve is to get aligned towards a specific journey in anatomical space. Here's what I mean by that. When you look at an early embryo, here's an embryonic blastodisk. There might be, let's say, 100,000 cells. We look at this and we say, oh, there's an embryo. What are you counting when you say there's one embryo? What is there one of? Because actually there's 100,000 cells. And within each one of those there are organelles and chemicals and so on. What are you actually counting? I'm going to say that what you're actually counting is alignment. You are counting the fact that all of these cells, under normal circumstances, all of these cells are committed to the same story, to the same model of where in anatomical space they are going to go. Anatomical space is basically the space of all possible geometric configurations of the body. And all of these cells are going to collaborate on building one particular structure, Meaning they're going to get from the point of a single cell to the configuration of this complicated embryo. Because they have all bought into the same story about where they're going to go. Okay, what keeps these things aligned is a self model that they all accept.",

When I'm talking to you right now, I'm not worried about reaching into your brain and having to arrange all the synapses so that you remember what I've said. I'm giving you information on a very thin communications channel. And I'm trusting you as a high end cognitive system to do all the biochemistry downstream that's required for you to react to what I'm saying. The same thing is true here. This, this signal was present for 24 hours. And after that we've shown a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. The goal is not to micromanage it. It is not to tell the cells what to do. It is not to 3D print scaffolds for stem cells. None of that. The goal is to convince it on day one that this is the path you should go.

Almost any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent. Life is incredibly interoperable. So hybrids and cyborgs and chimeras of every kind all make use of these ingressing patterns, which is a whole other thing we could talk about from, from mathematics and computation that create viable beings. Everything that Darwin saw when he said endless forms, most beautiful meaning natural life is a tiny little blip here on this enormous space of beings with whom we are going to share our world. Many of these things already exist. Many more are forthcoming. And what we need is to.",
