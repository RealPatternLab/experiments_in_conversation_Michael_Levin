When you wake up in the morning, you may have very high level executive goals, social goals, career goals, whatever. And in order for you to execute behavior that implements those goals, this intent must move ions across the cell membrane in your muscle cells. So this ability of high level intelligence and its goals to control the chemistry of the body is not some rare and unusual phenomenon. It is the everyday miracle that is implemented by the electrical system of the body. There's a scientist called Fabrizio Benedetti who, who has this beautiful phrase through his work on the placebo effect. And we'll come back to this at the end. He says words and drugs have the same mechanism of action. And this is because the intelligence of the mind and the mechanisms that drive the physiology and the morphology of the body are really part of the same system. And this is very important, I think, for the future of medicine. And this is what I will talk about today. The first thing to realize is that all of us are in an important sense, collective intelligences. Not just ants and, and termites and bird flocks and things like that, but all of us, because we are all made of a very interesting agential material.",

They directly encode the hardware that every cell gets to have. Once you have that hardware, you still have to figure out how the physiological software grows a particular structure. How does it know when to stop? What happens if cells decide to do something different? In the case of cancer, for example, if something is missing or damaged, how do we induce them to repair and to rebuild it again? And as engineers, although I won't talk about this today, we have a lot of work asking, what else can these cells build? Can we get build something completely different that is not what their native outcome is at all? And I want to point out that in order to solve this problem, genetic information is not enough.

In my lab, we make something called a frog, a lottl. So it's a hybrid, it's a combination. It has some cells from the axolotl, some cells from the frog, and we make a chimeric embryo. Now, I ask you a simple question. Will froglottles have legs or not? We have the genomes. You have the axolotl genome, you have the frog genome. Could you tell me if the frog, a lottl, is going to have legs? If it is going to have legs, will Those legs be made entirely of axolotl cells or will they be made of some frog cells? We currently have no ability to predict this from the genomes. We know the entire sequence. No one can tell you if froglottles are going to have legs. And that's because while molecular medicine is very good at this low level kind of description, which proteins interact with which other proteins and so on, we are really a long way away from large scale form and function. What we want in biomedicine is when somebody comes to you and they're missing an arm, or they had a birth defect or a tumor or something else, and they want you to grow them a new one, or perhaps even change the one they have into a different shape. We are still at the very beginning of knowledge with this. And I think that's because we are in biology today, where computer science was in the 1940s and 1950s.",

So we see birds or primates, maybe a whale or an octopus or something, and we see medium sized objects moving through three dimensional space at medium speeds and we can notice intelligence. But I want to stress that in biology there are many other spaces in which intelligences navigate and make decisions and solve problems and feel stress and so on. There is transcriptional space, so the space of all possible gene expression levels, there is physiological state space. And this one we'll talk more about today, which is anatomical morphospace or the space of possible anatomical configurations. In all of these spaces, they are very hard for us to visualize.

You have a physiological, a very strong physiological problem and you need to figure out which of your genes you're going to turn on or off to solve this problem.

And of course, if you start randomly changing genes, you're most likely to kill the cells anyway. How do you find in this scenario? What should you do for this novel problem?

Now we know that development is incredibly reliable. So these eggs reliably will give rise to a normal target morphology. And also we know that there's a huge rise in complexity from this state state. Anatomically complexity rises. But the reason I'm calling this intelligence is not because it becomes more complex or because it is reliable. That's not sufficient for intelligence. What I'm talking about is problem solving. And specifically the idea that if you take these early mammalian embryos, for example, and you cut them into pieces, you don't get half bodies. What you get are perfectly normal monozygotic twins and triplets. And that's because this process can reach the goal state, the goal state in anatomical space being something like a normal human morphology, from different starting positions.

So all of this stuff has to rearrange. You might think, and people did think, that this was just a hardwired set of processes. Every organ moves in the right direction, the right amount, and eventually you go from a normal tadpole to a normal frog. So we decided to test that in order to see the intelligence of these materials, you need to challenge them with problems. You need to do perturbations, functional perturbations. What we did was we created the so called Picasso like tadpoles. What's happening here is, look, the eyes on the back of the head, the mouth is off to the side. The whole thing is scrambled, everything is rearranged. And what we found is that they still make remarkably normal frogs because all of these organs move through novel paths. In fact, sometimes they go too far and they must come back. They go through novel paths until they get to where they're going and then they stop. And we could track all of this with CT scan. It turns out that the genetics does not specify a hardwired set of movements. What it gives you is a system that executes an error minimization scheme. It is able to detect that it's in the wrong position, it's able to move in the correct direction, and then it stops when it's done.",

How does it navigate that anatomical morphous space. Okay, what kind of competencies does it have for navigation and how does it work? Well, we took our inspiration from another system where we know what sorts of mechanisms lead from high level goals in some kind of problem space to the actuation of movement in that space. The most familiar, of course, is the nervous system. The hardware in the nervous system looks like this. You have neurons that have ion channels in their membrane. These ion channels produce a voltage gradient which may or may not be propagated through electrical synapse to their neighbors. And the movement of this electrical information through the network is what underlies the thing that I talked about at the beginning of the, of the talk, which is the ability to pursue goals in a problem space, right?

By rearranging that pattern somewhere else, you can call up whole entire organ. So it's clearly functionally determinative of what happens. It's not an epiphenomenon. The second thing is that it is incredibly modular, meaning that we didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye. We didn't say anything about stem cells, about gene expression, about the geometry of all the different tissues inside the eye. We didn't say any of that. All we provided was a very high level subroutine call that says build an eye here. And this is really great for regenerative medicine because that means we can call up complex downstream outcomes without having to or knowing how to micromanage the details. And then finally, just to point out another interesting competency of the material, look, this is a cross section through an eye in the flank of an embryosome somewhere.

Much like ants and termites, a different kind of collective intelligence recruits their friends from the, from the colony to help them move heavy objects. We didn't have to teach the cells to do that. They already do it. As soon as these cells learn that they must make it out, they take on the next step of instructing all these other cells that you have to help. And here's how we make an eye. All of these are things that we have to take advantage of. And this is not available from the bottom up level of genes or proteins or anything like that. We have to understand the decision making and the collective competencies of our material. I want to show you another story about limb regeneration. Normally in frogs, if you amputate the limb, unlike salamanders, frogs do not regenerate their legs at this adult stage. What you actually is something quite interesting. We call it injury. Mirroring the cut leg will, will show you a bioelectric signal here at the wound, but so will the uncut leg. Within 30 seconds, the information passes to the leg that was never touched. And that leg lights up at exactly the same location where the wound happened on the opposite side. It is not neurally mediated. You can remove the spinal cord, it still works fine. That information is spread across and we know bioelectrical networks are really good at spreading information.",

So now those of you interested medicine now can start to think what Kind of information about disease and injury is available at a distance on the opposite side of the body that we could read and have some kind of surrogate site diagnostics where you don't have to actually measure the tissue. You're talking about what other tissues are picking up damage information like that. But going beyond that, we decided to test if we could tell these cells to go to the regeneration area, not in the amorphous space, not the scarring area. We developed a cocktail of ionophore that basically triggers regeneration and immediately you start to get toes, you get a toenail, eventually you get a quite nice leg that keeps growing. The leg is touch sensitive, it is motile, you know, well patterned, fairly respectable. Again, the thing is that we don't say how to build a leg, we don't know how to build a leg. All we tell the cells is we communicate the goal, we say build a leg and then we don't touch it. A one day intervention with our cocktail tail results in a year and a half of leg growth, during which time we don't touch it at all. Once you've communicated to the cells, they do the rest. And at this point I have to do a disclosure because there's a company here called Morphaceuticals, which was started by David Kaplan and myself. And we are now moving that technology through the use of wearable bioreactors into mammals and eventually we hope into human patients to be able to use these stimuli, these triggers of complex organ regeneration.",

The eyes are connected to the brain. There's not the right shape. Everything is problematic here. We decided to ask, what can we do about this? Could we fix this somehow?

With this dominant Notch mutation, look, the forebrain is basically gone. The midbrain and hindbrain are just bubbles. These animals have no behavior. They're profoundly affected. This is a radical birth defect. Now, what we did was we asked this model how could we fix this. The model pointed us to one specific ion channel called HCM. And it suggested that if we turn on HCN2, the sharpness of the pattern that is ruined here, and I'm skipping a lot of information for a lack of time that I could show you what these patterns look like, that basically what's happening here is that the pattern has become blurry or fuzzy. It's just not sharp enough. And the edges, the brain doesn't know where the edges are. And so we used the opening of HCN2 to sharpen that pattern. And when we do that, and you could do that with drugs that open in native HCN2, or you can introduce novel HCN2 RNA. In either case, case, you're back to a normal shaped brain, normal gene expression in the brain, and in fact their IQs come back to normal.

But you couldn't tell that from their behavior or from the anatomy or from the gene expression. They're all fixed. And so at least in some cases, and I'm not saying this will be true in all cases, but at least in some cases, certain hardware defects can be fixed in software by communicating the correct pattern to the cells, regardless of what's underneath and what would have happened normally with the hardware. So this is our roadmap for birth defect repair. And so what we're doing now is creating this, the system, we call it eden, the electroceutical design environment, where you know what the electric state is that's incorrect, that you're trying to fix. If we do enough physiomics to get the data so that you know what the correct, correct pattern is, then you can ask the computational system which ion channel targets are the ones that are going to get you from the wrong state to the correct state. And so you can already play with this.",

And of course there's a failure mode, unfortunately, to this process, and that's cancer. So this is human glioblastoma. What's happening here is that these cells are disconnecting from the electrical network. Network. When they disconnect, they can no longer remember this giant thing they're working on. They're back to their ancient unicellular, tiny little cognitive light cone. And then these cells, these cells are not more selfish than normal cells. They just have smaller selves.

But the idea is to have a kind of augmented reality goggles along with a voltage sensitive dye so that surgeons or even people at home actually with these dyes can look and see pre cancer. They can see cells that are about to disconnect from the network, and they can see the margins of the tumor. And this is where the aberrant electrical states are. We're hoping to create something like that. But even more importantly than just detecting it, you can imagine what if we forcibly reconnected these cells to their neighbors, not kill them with toxic chemotherapy, but just reconnect them. And so here is an animal injected with a nasty oncogene. We've done Kras mutations, dominant, negative P53, all those kinds of things. What you'll see is that the oncoprotein is still blazingly expressed here. It's very strong, but there is no tumor, because this is the same animal here, because we co injected an ion channel that forces. It doesn't kill the cells, it doesn't remove the oncoprotein, but what it does do is force the cells into an electrical network that will work towards large scale goals, building nice skin, nice muscle, and so on. And we think this is also this normalization, this tumor reprogramming or normalization approach, not at the genetic level. Here's another example where the physiological state drives the outcome, not the genetic state, but the physiological information drives the outcome. We've now started moving from the frog model into the human model.",

Here's one. One. These are human neurons plated in a dish here and here. We've made a scratch wound. It's a defect, it's a scratch. And they navigate these wounds, they traverse them.

They're made of the patient's own cells, they go into your body, they do healing properties like this natively, or maybe we've taught them to do other things and then eventually they biodegrade. But they are your own cells and they already know what health, disease, stress, inflammation, cancer, these are all things that cells already understand. We don't need to manufacture this from scratch, such as mechanical nanobots and things like that. I'll stop here and just summarize on what I've tried to say is that I think the rate limiting step in truly transformative regenerative medicine is our ability to communicate goals to cellular swarms, to view them not as complex, complex, complex machines, but actually agents, problem solving agents with goals and preferences and, and agendas that we need to communicate and collaborate with. Genetics and big data are not sufficient for this CRISPR and things like that. You know, the biggest problem is going to be what genes do you crispr, you know, what genes do you edit? It's, it's this kind of bottom up approach for complex problems is not going to be sufficient efficient. Fortunately we have a roadmap for this and it comes from behavior science and neuroscience. And we can exploit the native computation competencies of the software of life. Top down control, resetting their goals, resetting their set points, not trying to micromanage them molecularly. And specifically the bioelectric interface. I mean there's a lot of different kinds of intelligence in cell groups, but bioelectricity is a very nice interface to that intelligence, much like it is in the nervous system.",
