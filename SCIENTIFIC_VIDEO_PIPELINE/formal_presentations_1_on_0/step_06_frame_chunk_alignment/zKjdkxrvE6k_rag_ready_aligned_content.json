Okay, so here are four things I'm going to try to talk about very quickly. First of all, I'm going to address this issue of biology, solving problems at all levels, in all kinds of problem spaces, and argue that genomes are not drivers, if anything, they are more like libraries of affordances, and that evolution makes problem solving agents, not solutions to specific problems. I will not have time to talk about this. Normally, if I give a long talk, I actually show how we go about communicating with the agential material that underlies life, because this is where we have most of our data. Then what I will talk about is give some thoughts about basically the fact that the architecture of life is fundamentally creative because it is dealing with an unreliable substrate, and that this gives rise to a really powerful intelligence ratchet. And towards the end, if we have time, I'll talk about some recent ideas about shifting the perspective of agents versus data and how the notion of Platonic space can be actually useful for research.",

        "text": "So what I'm interested in is to address something that I think we have, which is a degree of mind blindness. And it's an analogy. You can think about this as the electromagnetic spectrum. It used to be back in the day that things that happen when you wave magnets around, light, X rays, all of those things were thought to be very, very different things. Actually, could we mute somebody? Somebody's. Yep, there we go. Thank you. And, and something, something really interesting happened when we ended up with a proper theory of electromagnetism, which is that first of all, phenomena that were thought to be extremely different turned out to be manifestations of the same thing. And so we, we, we have an idea for how they relate to each other. And it allowed a technology to be made that enables us to detect and interact with and make use of all kinds of things that were completely inaccessible to us with our natural set of senses. And so I think something like that is happening with cognition, where evolution has given us some firmware that enables us to recognize certain extremely narrow range of kinds of minds. And I think we need to develop theory and that will lead to practical tools to enable us to recognize, create, and ethically relate to a very wide, diverse set of intelligences, regardless of how they got here or what they're made of. And so we're interested in my group, in understanding how to relate to all of these kinds of weird things. And in particular very important to move experimental work forward.",

All of this is similar to what happened to different kinds of numbers where we slowly, with certain kinds of schisms and people sort of freaking out when they discover certain new kinds of numbers we've kind of enlarged. Even though some of these sets are infinite, we've discovered novel degrees of infinity and new kinds of numbers.

Eventually we end up being something like this. This is what we're made of. These are single cells. They're extremely. I mean this is a free living organism. But you can see in a single cell, no brain, no nervous system, it has all kinds of capacities to pursue its own tiny little goals. And then life normally goes this way. It can take some twists and turns, it can have a breakdown of Multicellularity, a kind of dissociative identity disorder of the collective intelligence that gives rise to cancer. It can also, with our help, go into new directions, such as these anthrobots, which can continue life even after a patient has died. And we can talk about all that. And what fundamentally happens to bring us into the world is alignment and a kind of dynamic storytelling. And what I mean by that is that when we look at an embryo, and there may be, let's say at an early stage, it's a sheet of 100,000 cells. Why do we look at that and we say there's one embryo, what is there one of? If there's 100,000 cells, what's there one of? Well, what there's one of is a particular model, a commitment to travel in anatomical space to a particular location that describes whatever it is that's being built.

So you can, you can read out these pattern memories if you continue to cut these two headed animals that the memory holds. It's a bioelectric memory. It is not controlled by the genetics. The genetics are totally wild type. Nothing has changed. Changes in the genome sequencing the genome will not tell you that these things have two heads. It will also not tell you that the whole lineage will have two heads because you can keep cutting them. And in fact, when they reproduce, they cut themselves in half on their own and then they regenerate. They will continue to be two headed. Here's a video. You can see what these guys are doing.",

This is a cross section through the kidney tubule of a salamander. So normally 8 to 10 cells that make this thing up. What you can do is you can make these newts with more copies of their genetic material. So when you have more copies of their genetic material, so instead of 2N chromosomes, you can have 4N, 5N, 6N and so on. When you do this, the cells get bigger, but the newt stays the same size. Well, how can that be? Well, it's because the cell, there's actually few fewer cells that make up the same structure. The cells are bigger, but there's less of them. Okay. And then when you make the cells truly gigantic, what you find is that one cell will bend around itself like this and leave a space in the middle, same structure.",

They have to turn into this thing that lives in the three dimensional world and it forms, flies around, and it's a hard bodied creature and it needs a completely different controller for that. And so in the meantime, what it does is it basically liquefies its brain, kills most of the cells, breaks most of the connections, and then eventually rebuilds a new butterfly brain.

And again, all of this, all of this is here. One of the cool things about it is that this gives rise to an interesting intelligence, ratchet. So the more creative interpretation of your genome you do during development, the harder it is for selection to actually know whether your genome was any good or not. And we've done simulations of this to show that what happens when you evolve over a competent material like this is that the pressure on the structural genome comes off and all of the work of evolution starts being done on the actual algorithm of, of the creative interpretation of the tools that you have. Because with each sort of run through that loop, it becomes harder and harder to select better genomes because you can't see them. You can just see the fact that useful phenotypes had appeared. And so I think that ratchet started very early on, and it contributes to the amazing, you know, sort of conventional intelligence that we see in the, in the animal world.

Because for all of the natural systems, you could say, well, evolution did that. Evolution gave you the goal. And that's what we normally say. Why does this animal look the way it looks? Why does it have behaviors that it has? Because of selection. Eons of selection gave you that goal. Okay, what happens in novel systems? I'm very interested in where goals come from.

The patient that donated these may or may not be alive, but these guys have rebooted their multicellularity. They do some cool stuff.

And who would have known, who would have known that your tracheal cells can do this? And we've done this with, with frog embryos too. These are xenobots, which are made from frog skin cells, from embryonic epithelial cells. They don't have the ability to reproduce the way normal frogs do, but they've figured out something different. This is basically von Neumann's dream of a robot that finds material and makes copies of itself. If you provide them with loose epithelial cells, they will push them together into little piles and they then sort of polish the little piles. The little piles mature into the next generation of xenobots. And guess what that does? It does the same thing. It makes the next generation and the next. None of this existed before in evolution. There's been no evolutionary pressure to be a good xenobot or to be a good anthrobot. And so now we're confronted with some, with two options in order to try to deal with these novel, novel forms, behaviors and other patterns that, that are not directly selected for by evolution. We can say they're emergent, which basically just means that they're surprising to us. We can catalog them and when we come across them, well, there they are. We find emergent things. I don't really like it. I like it allows you to have a sparse ontology, but it's kind of a mysterious position. I don't like just saying that. Well, it's a fact that holds in the physical world.",

And so what I think are, is that the Platonic space doesn't just contain things that mathematicians like, such as facts about prime numbers and such, but also things that we would recognize as kinds of minds, in other words, behavioral patterns and capabilities. And what we make when we make, when, when we perceive, produce embryos, xenobots, computers, pretty much anything. You're not really making these kinds of things. What you're doing is making pointers that allow the ingression of specific patterns from that space into the physical world.
