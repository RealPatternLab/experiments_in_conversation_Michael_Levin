And we all thought those were different things, okay? We thought these were, these were completely different kinds of, kinds of phenomena.

What there's one of is a story that all of the cells have bought into a self model that guides their movement in anatomical space, in the space of possible anatomical configurations. And the reason there's one embryo is because all the cells agree that is where they're going. If you were to, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a graduate student. If you take a little needle and you put some scratches in this plastoderm. Each one of these islands doesn't feel a presence of the others, and so they align among themselves. They decide they're the embryo, but they all do it. And this is how you get twins and triplets and things like this. That means that the number of individuals inside an embryonic medium is not determined. It's certainly not set by genetics. It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more in a standard blastoderm. And so how many actual individuals or cells can emerge from that medium is not obvious. And it's a physiological outcome that shares actually a lot of both mechanistic and functional similarities with issues of individuation in the cognitive sense.",

It's the electrical networking of the cells in your brain that allow us to know things that our neurons don't know, and so on.

So from metabolic spaces, physiological spaces, gene expression spaces, eventually multicellularity, and you get anatomical amorphous space, then muscles and brains appear and you've got 3D behavioral space and then eventually linguistic spaces, and who knows what else. But the interesting thing here is that what our brains are using to embody conventional Cognition is exactly the same molecular mechanisms, meaning ion channels, electrical synapses and neurotransmitters. Exactly the same machinery as the collective intelligence of the body uses to make anatomical decisions. And so this is interesting. I don't plan to talk about consciousness too much in this talk, but just, just when I give these kinds of talks, I remind people that when you attribute consciousness to other humans that you're talking to or other beings, you typically use one of three criteria.",

In other words, if biologists will say that, that whatever form you have is driven by your evolutionary history, are there any for any beings that, that are picking up forms that cannot be explained in this way? So I'm going to show you just one. This is something called an anthrobot. If I showed it to you for the first time, you may have already seen this. If you saw this for the first time, you might be tempted to guess that this is some sort of primitive organism that we picked up at the bottom of a pond somewhere. You might take a guess about its genome. You might think that, well, this will have an early genome of an early metazoan.",

But if you know how to look, you also find it doing all kinds of interesting side quests that the algorithm does not ask them to do that are, in fact, kinds of, that are things that you would recognize as aspects of cognition, very minimal, but yet there they are. And so, and so I really think this goes all the way down. This ability to have the freedom to express patterns from that space that are not fully determined by the physics of your world or the algorithms that, that we think you are following, it is always richer than that, even in extremely simple systems. And so just, just to remind us again, you know, Magritte was telling us that, that our formal models are not the thing itself. And I would say the same thing. You know, there's a lot of organic thinkers who are down on computationalism, and they say living things aren't, aren't machines. They say, right, nothing is machine because a machine is a formal model that humans have defined to, to handle certain aspects of what physical objects do in the world. And it doesn't fully describe even the simplest kinds of systems, never mind, of course, the biological systems.",
