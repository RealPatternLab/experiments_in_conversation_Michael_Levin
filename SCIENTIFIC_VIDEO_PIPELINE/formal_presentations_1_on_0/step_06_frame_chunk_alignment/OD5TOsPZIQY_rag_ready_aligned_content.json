He's going to check in a minute to see whether anybody's watching, right? So these kinds of things, it's very easy for us to understand that there's a mind here. And so on. And that's because they operate at the same spatial temporal scale. They operate within the same space as we do. They have roughly similar biological goals. And so things that are driven by brains, especially mammals, not really problematic, usually. Well, there are some weird situations.",

There are cases where individuals have radically reduced amounts of brain tissue despite normal or even above normal performance. Even that's not simple. The mapping between brain and performance, even that's not easy. But in order to really understand what we are and how we come to be as embodied agents, we need to look at our origins, both evolutionarily and developmentally. All of us start life as a little blob of chemistry and physics. Here's an unfertilized oocyte. Through the incredible process of embryogenesis, we become a fodder for either behavioral science or maybe psychoanalysis and other deeper kinds of things. One thing developmental biology shows us is that there is no magic kind of bright line at which. At which physics ticks over to psychology. There is no special place where that happens. It's a continuous, gradual process, and it's really important to be able to understand that process. And by the way, this is not the end of the road because there are other processes that can happen afterwards, including dissociative disorder known as cancer. I'll talk about that in a minute. And really other very strange things, such as your cells, for example, after the death of the body, your cells continuing their life in a totally novel embodiment such as these anthrobots that I'm going to show you in a minute. And it's also important to note that even the notion of an embryo isn't simple, because if you look at an early blastoderm.",

What is there one of? Well, what there's one of is alignment. What there's one of is a story that all of the cells have bought into a self model that guides their movement in anatomical space, in the space of possible anatomical configurations. And the reason there's one embryo is because all the cells agree that is where they're going. If you were to, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a graduate student. If you take a little needle and you put some scratches in this plastoderm. Each one of these islands doesn't feel a presence of the others, and so they align among themselves. They decide they're the embryo, but they all do it. And this is how you get twins and triplets and things like this. That means that the number of individuals inside an embryonic medium is not determined. It's certainly not set by genetics. It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more in a standard blastoderm. And so how many actual individuals or cells can emerge from that medium is not obvious. And it's a physiological outcome that shares actually a lot of both mechanistic and functional similarities with issues of individuation in the cognitive sense.",

It's the electrical networking of the cells in your brain that allow us to know things that our neurons don't know, and so on.

Doesn't hurt that it's kind of very organic looking, which is why I use this example. But what's salient here is that there's a tiny seed. It encodes a very complex, very rich kind of structure. And if you wanted to explain why it looks like this, there are no facts of the physical world that explain it. There is nothing in the history of, of the physics of the universe that explains why this is the way it is. The explanation does not come from the physical world. You cannot tweak any of the, you know, the, the constants of, of the universe at the beginning of the Big Bang. And get a different pattern out of this. It, it is an extra thing that is, is distinct from information you get from your genetic lineage and information you get from your physical environment. Environment.

You know, there's a lot of organic thinkers who are down on computationalism, and they say living things aren't, aren't machines. They say, right, nothing is machine because a machine is a formal model that humans have defined to, to handle certain aspects of what physical objects do in the world.

And I think for exactly the same reason that the rules of biochemistry don't encompass the story of the human mind. Formal models of algorithms and materials do not encompass the story of minimal beings. So really, I think we have to get much wider in our perception of what we can relate with. So I'll just, I'm going to end here and just thank the people who did the work that I showed you. Here's some postdocs and students and collaborators in our lab and disclosures are three companies that have spun off from the work that we do. And of course, thank our funders and the model systems because they've done the most hard work in teaching us about this stuff.",
