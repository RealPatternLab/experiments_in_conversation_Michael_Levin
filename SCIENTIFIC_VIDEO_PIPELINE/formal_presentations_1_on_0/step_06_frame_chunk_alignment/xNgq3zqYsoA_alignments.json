So let's try it and see how it goes. If you want to follow up on any of the science here, this is my official lab webpage that has all the papers, the data sets, the software, all that stuff. And then this is my personal blog with some kind of somewhat crazier version of what I think all of these things mean and so on. So what I'd like to do today is first just give you a quick outline of what I'm going to do, the kind of the journey I'm going to take you on. I'm going to try in the next 25 minutes to take you through a few different things. And fundamental to ethics is I think, this question of what should I do next? And I think fundamental to that is the question of what am I really? And how do I relate to the outside world? And this is a lot of what we do, even though we have a wet lab, a large wet lab where we do all kinds of work on cancer and bioengineering and so on.",

Not just brainy mammals and birds and things like that, but all the way down. The implications of that, amazingly enough, are that we can reach all kinds of interesting new biomedicine if we understand how intelligence is implemented in our bodies.

I'm not a clinician, I'm not an md, but I get emails, probably a dozen emails per day from people in the most unbelievable extremes of pain and infirmity and disease and whatever. And so it's really hard for young, healthy people to realize what we're actually talking about here. And so I think, yeah, we absolutely have to think about the risks, but we also have to think about the ethical imperative to do something to help the situation. And I actually think it is a kind of moral cowardice to sort of leave it alone and say, not my problem. I'm just going to sit back and try not to make things worse. I think that's not the right way to go. And also, of course, there's issues with the environment and so on. Past the biomedical kinds of things. I'm going to talk about this notion of freedom of embodiment, because after we learn to fix all of the issues of the body towards the normal standard complement of form and function, then you realize that you can use the exact same tools to actually create any kind of embodiment that you want. And so this is something, of course, that we can think about in any discussion of ethics.

And one of the things that I try to do in my group is to develop a framework and that allows us to think about diverse intelligences, so all kinds of weird colonial organisms and engineered new life forms that have never existed before. I'm going to show you some today. Artificial intelligence, whether purely software or robotic, maybe someday aliens. And even really exotic things that don't look like beings at all, such as patterns, actually active patterns with the media. And so that spectrum, instead of the electromagnetic spectrum, what we have here is a spectrum of agency, okay? And we could talk about this for the longest time, but fundamentally what we have is some kind of a gradual continuum where passive matter, if there even is such a thing, slowly scales up its cognitive capacities to eventually become something like a metacognitive human or whatever is beyond that. And so this is what we work on, if you're interested.

Now, this is kind of shocking. Why don't these animals, where the eye does not connect to the brain, so here the eye makes an optic nerve. That optic nerve might synapse onto the spinal cord. It might Go to the gut, it might go nowhere at all. Why does this work out of the box? How come you don't need rounds of evolutionary mutation, selection, adaptation, all that stuff to accommodate this completely novel sensorimotor architecture? And so, and it's because of that plasticity that I told you a minute ago, because evolution does not make fixed solutions to fixed environments. It makes problem solving agents that, you know, these cells never assumed the tadpole was going to be the same all the time anyway. It's going to. They figure out a way to make it work. And one way they do that. And so you understand, I'm using. I'm using this example of cells navigating anatomical space as a case study or a, a model of an unconventional intelligence. We don't have any aliens, but we do have intelligences that live in very different problem spaces. And we can use that as a way to start understanding how do we communicate, how do we detect intelligence? And so I showed you some ways of doing that.

Now that we understand a little bit about how they think we can communicate certain goals, here's one thing we can do, is to tell a frog. Frogs don't regenerate their legs. Unlike that salamander that I showed you, we can, we can tell these cells here to go down the leg building path instead of the scarring path. And so by 45 days, then you already have some toe, some toes you've got, a toenail, you've got, and eventually a very respectable looking functional leg. We did that by providing specific ion channel drugs at this interface to put the cells in an electrical state where they remember that they need to build a limb as opposed to scarring and stopping. We are currently doing this. And so I have to do a disclosure because this is a company that was spun out of our lab with David Kaplan. To do this in mammals and hopefully someday humans.",

This is now a second application around limb and organ regeneration. So using electrical cues to tell cells to rebuild the things they already know how to rebuild. It's not just about rebuilding the exact thing in the right place. You can also do interesting things like this. We can tell a bunch of cells that would have been gut, we can say no. Instead you should make an eye. And the way we do that is we inject some ion channel RNA that establishes a bioelectrical signal and that tells the cells to build an eye. And they build an eye.

So the biomedical aspect. So there's two aspects of note here. The biomedical aspect is that someday you will have biobots made of your own cells that can be injected into your body to make repairs.

And so when we talk about ethics, a lot of people like to compare, well, I'm a real human, and then there are these machines and we're very different. Well, the problem you're all going to be facing in your lifetime, no doubt about it, is not what to do with language models sitting inside a server somewhere. It's this, this guy has had various modifications and there are a lot of people who are going to be interested in figuring out is this a quote unquote real human? Is it? You know, what are we going to do? Is it 51% implants and now you're not a real human? What is going to happen to beings that are, that are extended, rationally extended and modified in other ways? And that opens up numerous questions and really I think is going to be very difficult and lead to a lot of moral lapses if we insist on binary categories where using old school methods, we're going to try to figure out if this is a human or a machine.
