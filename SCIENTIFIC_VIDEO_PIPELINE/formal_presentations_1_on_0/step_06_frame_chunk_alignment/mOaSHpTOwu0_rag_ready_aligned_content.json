        "text": "Perfect. Okay, thank you so much. Very excited to be here and share some ideas with you. I'm going to say some kind of large scale conceptual things in addition to some data that I'm going to show you. And it's hard to do that in, in 15 minutes. So if anybody wants to download the primary data, the software, the, you know, all of that stuff is here. And then this is just a personal blog where I try to write about what I think some, some of these things mean. And this is a lot of what I'll say at the end is work done in collaboration with Josh Bongaard's lab as part of this ICDO organization that we have. And what I'm going to describe today is this notion of agential materials and a way of interacting with your materials that are more around the concepts of collaboration and literally a kind of social engineering with your material. Because we view these things as a collective intelligence that we want to motivate, not just rewire or micromanage. And so one of the great challenges in our field, which is both synthetic morphology and biomedicine, is that someday you want to sit in front of a computer and you want to draw the plant animal, biobot, organ, whatever you want, with no limitations really. And what this thing should do is compile that description down to a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build whatever you want, such as this three headed flatworm. And of course, if we had something like this, a lot of problems in biomedicine would go away and a lot of problems in bioengineering would be solved.",

But as we all know, we don't have anything remotely like this. We can only do this in a very small, if at all, in a very small set of circumstances. And I think that's largely because we've been thinking so far about either passive matter, now increasingly active matter, computational materials. But in biology, I think what we're dealing with is what I call an agential material. It's a material that at multiple scales has agendas and problem solving capacities which we have not largely have not yet taken advantage of. And so for me, the anatomical compiler is not some sort of 3D printer. It is a communications device. It is a translator between your goals as the engineer and the goals of the material.

There's no brain, there's no nervous system. It's handling all of its needs in anatomical space and metabolic space and physiological space. From that one cell normally develop all of these kinds of amazing creatures, including these that will actually have very significant problem solving cognitive capacities. What we know from developmental biology is that this is a slow and grad. There is no specific magic line at which intelligence kicks in. This is a process of scaling competencies, not a process of magical categories. And so we need to understand the scaling in order to have good interactions with the material. In fact, it turns out that even below the single cell level, so just the molecular networks themselves, let's say gene regulatory networks or molecular pathways, already have six different kinds of learning that they can do. This does not require a cell or synapses or any of that, just the molecular pathways themselves. And this is a free gift from the mathematics of networks. They can already do habituation, association, pavlovian conditioning. And we're now taking advantage of all of that for experiments in drug conditioning for biomedical purposes. And so the material has these capacities sort of all the way from the very bottom. And what I think is happening here is a kind of multi scale competency architecture where each level, and so here are all the levels of organization. Each level is basically deforming the option space for the levels below, but each level is navigating that space. Context sensitive navigation of the option space. And these are transcriptional spaces, physiological state spaces, anatomical morphous space.",

Why does this animal, with a novel sensorimotor architecture, not require new rounds of mutation selection adaptation? No, it works out of the box. And the plasticity for these kinds of things is absolutely enormous. And we can really take advantage of this in bioengineering. It's not just animals, plants do this too. Development is an incredibly reliable process. And you might think that what the oak genome encodes is the ability to build this flat green thing. It does it all the time, very consistently, except that along comes a non human bioengineer, this wasp, and it puts down some prompts that cause these cells to build something completely different. Okay, so here's this round, spiky red and orange thing, here's another one. They're called galls. There's an amazing variety of them. And they're not made from insect cells, they're made from plant cells. And they're not built the way that wasps build their nests, which is basically a 3D printing approach where it goes around and sort of builds it piece by piece, it lays down some signals and it basically hacks the morphogenetic competency of these plants, which, by the way, we would have had no idea that they're even capable of this if, if, if we hadn't had this, this example.

Slumps, fungi kind of do the same. So nematodes and mites kind of make something that has a shape, but by the time you get to insects, you get this kind of beautiful structure.

We are okay at recognizing intelligence of medium sized objects moving at medium speeds through the three dimensional space that we're used to.",

In our group, we've been studying one particular kind of cognitive glue that binds individual cells with their agendas in transcriptional space and physiological space and so on into large scale multicellular constructs that navigate anatomical space. There are several kinds at least, but one kind of cognitive glue, much like in the brain, that does exactly the same thing for your neurons, making you more than just the pile of neurons, is bioelectricity. And so we have now ways to read and write electrical states into non neural tissue. We've developed these techniques over the last 20 years to basically take all of the tools of cognitive neuroscience and bring them into understanding the decision making, the memories, the problem solving capacities of non neural cells in navigating the space of possible shapes. And this, because now we understand what the cognitive glue is, we can start to use that as an interface to communicate new goals to the tissue. And so here, for example, and we could do this with drugs, with optogenetics, there are many ways to do it.",

All that we do is we engineer by subtraction, meaning that these cells normally are going to be bullied by these other cells and forced into being a boring two dimensional outer cover for the tadpole that keeps the bacteria out. But if you subtract this influence away and you ask what do these cells intrinsically want to do, then you see something interesting. They don't just crawl away from each other, they don't die or form a monolayer. They self assemble. And you can see actually each one of these circles is a single cell.",

So maybe there's a little bit of residual memory, but we're trying to figure that out. So all of these things, we're now doing behavioral experiments to ask, what do they remember?

This little thing, which looks like we got it off the bottom of a pond somewhere, is actually, if you were to sequence it, It's Homo sapiens, 100% wild type Homo sapiens. These are anthrobots made of human tracheal epithelial Cells. And they also do some interesting things. If you played a bunch of human neurons and you put a big scratch through it, they will traverse that scratch, but then they'll pick a spot and sit down and they sort of form the superbot cluster.

And I think just by itself, emergence is not going to do the trick. We really need to develop tools to understand, to map out that space and map out the interactions between the physical interfaces that we make and the patterns that we see.

Tools are coming online to communicate with these systems via bioelectrics and of course other modalities. Lots of, lots of applications.

And so the opportunity for a cross fertilization of this, of these field and roboticists, the opportunity are massive, I think. Other questions? Thanks so much, Michael, as always. Good to see you. Curious about the sound, how you chose that. Is it just like a really nice, precise, non invasive way to do mechano transection, or was there another reason that sort of motivated that choice? Okay, so the question of sound to begin with was simply because we did the transcriptomics and we found this cluster of hearing genes and we thought, okay, maybe this thing is trying to, maybe this is the bigger picture here, I think, is the idea that these novel systems with a novel lifestyle are problem solving in the sense that they. And I have other examples we could talk about that dip into their genome to start to transcribe things that are going to be useful in this lifestyle. Right. And so this, this sort of primed us when we saw the hearing, is that, okay, let's, let's just test it now in terms of what the sound, what the sound is. The only thing we've published so far is one single wavelength is a sine wave and that's it, right? One, one frequency and it's a sine wave. We are currently testing everything from a full frequency sweep to we play different kinds of music that we Let them talk to each other, because, you know, there's a million things. And so the jury's very much still open on what they're doing with that information. While I'm sure the molecular view of this thing is some sort of mechanotransaction, that's probably how they're hearing.",
