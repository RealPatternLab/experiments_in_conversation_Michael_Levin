  "text": "So we use all the same computational tools And then more importantly than just reading out those patterns, you want to be able to rewrite them And the way we do this is not by applied electric fields There are no magnets, no frequencies, no waves We basically hack the same interface that the cells are already using to talk to each other In other words, we can control at a molecular level the topology of the network by controlling these electrical synapses And of course we can turn individual channels on and on, whether that be optogenetics or drugs or whatever",
