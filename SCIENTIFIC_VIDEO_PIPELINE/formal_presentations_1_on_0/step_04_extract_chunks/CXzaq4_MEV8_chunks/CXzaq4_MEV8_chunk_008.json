  "text": "Whoa, sorry I don't know what's going on with this visual here, but there is another spectrum here, another continuum, which is the gradual technological and biological changes that can and will and are being applied to this kind of standard human with this sort of special agential glow And because biology is so highly interoperable, pretty much any, you know, you can introduce engineered material anywhere along the scale And so, you know, questions of life versus machines or what computers, quote, unquote, can and can't do, these are all very difficult now because of the existence of these chimeras And I think these are the difficult cases that we need to talk about, which, again, speak to models of transformation, not sharp categories",
