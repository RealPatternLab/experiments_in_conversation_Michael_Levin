  "text": "So I think we can get there step by step by first, considering the reasons that one might or might not assign at least some, some plausibility to consciousness outside of the brain, in our own bodies But more broadly, I think that issues around AI and many, many ethical Problems are not going to be resolved if we maintain a focus on humans, a focus on 3D space for embodiment, if we view the brain as necessarily privileged in some way, and if we try to maintain crisp binary categories of being conscious or not I think all of these things are preventing progress in this field And I will talk about why that is And towards the end, I'm going to say some, some, some really, I think, controversial things about what I think this all means for consciousness And basically the idea that I think physics and evolutionary history do not tell the whole story of, of what's going on here And I'm going to show you a model that in some ways is a very ancient model, and in other ways I think now is in a much different place",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of consciousness beyond the brain, the role of AI, and the importance of considering non-human-centric perspectives. They challenge the traditional view of consciousness and suggest that physics and evolutionary history do not fully explain consciousness. The speaker also hints at presenting a model that offers a different perspective on consciousness.",
