  "text": "So the first thing to realize is that there are patterns that are not set by either physics or history So what you're looking at here is something called a Halley plot And then I've made kind of videos of them that basically comes from plotting this formula in complex numbers It's very short, very simple But this is the kind of richness that this encodes, if you know how to look at it And the particular shape of this thing There is no fact of physics that sets this There is no evolutionary history that tells you why this is the case The explanation for why or for why this is the way it is comes from the properties of mathematical objects It is And so this is, I'm going to, I'm going to kind of push on this, on this concept for a few minutes This idea that there are specific patterns in mathematical objects that are neither determined by physics nor by any kind of evolutionary history There is another source Biologists don't like to think about that Biologists would like everything in biology to be explained either by some necessity of physics or by an evolutionary history of selection",
