  "text": "This is an example where the local order ends up obeying a very high level plan There's another profound thing that unifies cognition and morphogenesis, which is that at any given moment we cognitively don't have access to the past What we have access to are engrams, memory traces that we have formed in past instances of ourselves as a compression of our past experience So you end up with this, with this kind of architecture, this kind of bowtie architecture where there's an algorithmic encoder that takes past experiences and sort of squeezes it down into some sort of memory that is in our brain or body",
