  "text": "So this whole thing gets remodeled into a limb Okay, now notice something very interesting These cells up here are tail tip cells sitting at the end of a tail Why do they turn into fingers There's nothing wrong with them This is locally, there's no issue But the collective, not the individual cells, but the group actually knows very well that having a tail in the middle of the body is not the correct goal state So that attempt to reduce error trickles down to the molecular biology that is needed to turn tail cells into finger cells So this idea of control of low level phenomena in the service of higher level, perhaps very abstract goals that they know nothing about is something that is not just is not Unique to voluntary motion and things like that in our conventional brains, it actually is baked in all the way down into the way our bodies are assembled",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the process of cellular remodeling, where tail tip cells transform into finger cells. This process is guided by a collective 'knowledge' among cells that a tail in the middle of the body is incorrect, leading to molecular changes to correct this error. The speaker suggests this is an example of low level phenomena being controlled in service of higher, abstract goals.",
