  "text": "This is obviously very minimal, that even something as simplistic and dumb as a sorting algorithm has, is doing things that you neither prescribe for it to do, nor for, nor forbade it from, from doing And there's a lot of humility necessary here because if we don't understand bubble sort, which I think we haven't, then I don't think we understand language models or anything like that And by the way, just to mention, if you think the situation is better in the neural sciences, where people think they know what parts of the brain do and things like that, we've gathered some really interesting examples of human clinical data that really also suggests that in some ways the brain is basically a thin client because the mapping between brain architectures and the cognitive performance really breaks down in certain cases",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexity of understanding even simple algorithms, such as bubble sort, and how this lack of understanding extends to more complex models like language models. The speaker also challenges the understanding of brain function in neural sciences, suggesting that the brain may operate more like a thin client, with a disconnect between brain architecture and cognitive performance.",
