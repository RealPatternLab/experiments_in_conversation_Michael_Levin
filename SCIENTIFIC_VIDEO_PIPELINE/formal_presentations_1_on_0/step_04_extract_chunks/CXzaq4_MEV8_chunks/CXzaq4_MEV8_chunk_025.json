  "text": "This is experimental perturbation that makes the cells gigantic No problem It will just take one of these gigantic cells, bend it around itself using a completely different molecular mechanism than this Right So this is a kind of intelligence that you see on IQ tests Here are some objects you have, use them in a new way to solve a new problem that you've not seen before Yeah, no problem These cells figure out how to use cytoskeletal bending to create the same large scale outcome using very different molecular mechanisms And so, and so this kind of problem solving requires us to ask, how does the collective intelligence hold together and how does it know what it's supposed to do",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses an experimental perturbation that results in enlarged cells. These cells adapt by using cytoskeletal bending, a different molecular mechanism, to maintain their function. The speaker refers to this adaptive ability as a form of 'collective intelligence' among cells.",
