  "text": "But that is clearly not the only game in town And so what I would like to suggest the following, the following hypothesis that basically what's happening is, that is, is what Platonist mathematicians think is happening, which is that there is another space, an ordered structured space of truths that are not determined by any facts of the, of the physical world They're sort of independent in that sense But of course they affect the things that do happen in the physical world and that what they're doing is exploring this space in a systematic, structured way And so these patterns are, they have a causal influence on the physical world In physics we see them as constraints In biology, I think we actually see them as enablements I think we call biology systems that are actually making use of some of these as free lunches And so my hypothesis is this, basically what I'm taking is extending this, which is there are many mathematicians that already believe this I'm extending this in the following way I think this, this world of forms or the Platonic space, or the latent space, or whatever you want to call it, contains low agency patterns like facts about numbers and logic and the, you know, the truths about the prime numbers and things like that",
