  "text": "Now at this point, most of you are probably saying, well, interaction is dead This was killed off at the time of Descartes that there's this interaction problem There's a mental world and there's a physical world It just doesn't work to say that there's some kind of external patterns that are part of consciousness of beings You know, most people think that this has been put to bed a long time ago I think that because of, because of mathematics, I think that physicalism was already dead in Newton's universe In the classical, boring, deterministic universe, you don't need quantum mechanics for this As many people have tried to sort of resurrect this with a quantum mechanical interface, I don't think you need any of that Although maybe that's true too, I don't know",
