  "text": "So the kind of basic foundational idea here is that there's a very deep symmetry between the self creation of bodies and minds And I think Turing understood this It's, it's quite amazing that somebody who is really so interested in understanding intelligence in different guises and machine intelligence and computation and things like that He also wrote this amazing paper, the Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, where he thought about the question of how do embryos self assemble from a soup of unorganized chemicals And I think the reason he was interested in this question, question, which at first doesn't seem like it has a lot to do with this, I think he understood that there's a deep symmetry here And in fact it turns out that what evolution and developmental biology are telling us is that all of the amazing things that, that brains do were actually an evolutionary pivot of much more ancient mechanisms by which multicellular beings navigated anatomical space And we developed a tool I used to have my students do this by hand, but now, now we made a tool tool that, that you can all try You can take a The abstract of a paper in neuroscience And what it will do is every time it says neuron, it just says cell Every time it says millisecond, it will say minutes or hours And with very few similar shifts, you have yourself a developmental biology paper The symmetries are really, are really quite, quite striking And I don't have time today to show you all the examples in which the collective intelligence of cells during morphogenesis solves problems, navigates the space in a context sensitive way, contains memories of goals that it pursues I'll show you a little bit of that",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the deep symmetry between the self-creation of bodies and minds, referencing Turing's work on the chemical basis of morphogenesis. The speaker emphasizes the role of evolution and developmental biology in understanding this process, particularly the collective intelligence of cells during morphogenesis and their ability to navigate anatomical space.",
