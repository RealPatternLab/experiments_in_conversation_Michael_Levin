  "text": "So they try to recruit these guys, but these guys actually resist They have a cancer suppression mechanism that says if your neighbor has a weird voltage that's telling you to do something strange, try to resist In fact, try to normalize them and make sure they end up like you So there's this kind of battle of worldviews going on here between these cells that have bought into our message and these cells that may or may not And I want to show you one kind of cute example of what that looks like So again, the colors are voltage Here, these are two frames",
