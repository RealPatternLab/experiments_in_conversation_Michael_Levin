  "text": "This is a planarian These flatworms regenerate You can cut them into pieces And this middle fragment knows exactly how many heads or tails it should have And so very reliably, it makes one head, one tail And it does so because there is a memory of how many heads you're supposed to have, which we can read out exactly as you might do in the neural decoding context Here it is And what we can do is we can rewrite it So we've made an animal that now has And this is, of course, a little messy We're still working out the technology, but now it has a pattern that says two heads And when we cut this guy, sure enough, it makes a two headed animal",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the regenerative abilities of planarians, flatworms that can regenerate into complete organisms from fragments. The speaker mentions the existence of a 'biological memory' that determines the number of heads a fragment should have, and suggests the possibility of manipulating this memory to create two-headed organisms.",
