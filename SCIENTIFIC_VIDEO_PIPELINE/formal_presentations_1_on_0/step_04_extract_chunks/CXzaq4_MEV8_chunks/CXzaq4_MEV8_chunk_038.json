  "text": "So I want to move on from this to a synthetic morphology model, because what I've shown you so far are systems whose goals in anatomical space are determined by evolution So I want to show you, I want to show you some xenobots and the way that they're formed is that we take a frog embryo, we take some of these prospective epithelial cells up here, we put them In a dish We dissociate them here, we put them in the dish Now there's many things they could do They could die, they could walk away from each other They could form a two dimensional cell culture layer Instead what they do is they coalesce into this little unit And here, this is kind of neat",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the transition from evolutionary-determined systems to a synthetic morphology model, using xenobots as an example. These are created by manipulating frog embryos, specifically epithelial cells, which are then dissociated and observed as they coalesce into a unit in a dish.",
