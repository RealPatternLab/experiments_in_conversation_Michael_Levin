  "text": "Sometimes it goes up gradually, sometimes it goes up in spurts where they in fact fall asleep or sort of disband into their collective subunits You, in between the interactions you have with them, the activity doesn't stop They're highly active the whole time But actually the causal emergence falls when you're not talking to them So they can't keep themselves awake, so to speak But as you, as you, as you train them in particular in an associative conditioning paradigm The integration goes up and up and up and you can find all that here So the material of which we are made is itself has significant relevance to this problem of minds and unconventional is to understand how limited we are in terms of recognizing embodiment",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of causal emergence, which seems to fluctuate in the absence of external interaction. They also mention an associative conditioning paradigm that increases integration. The importance of understanding the material of which we are made and its relevance to the problem of minds is emphasized.",
