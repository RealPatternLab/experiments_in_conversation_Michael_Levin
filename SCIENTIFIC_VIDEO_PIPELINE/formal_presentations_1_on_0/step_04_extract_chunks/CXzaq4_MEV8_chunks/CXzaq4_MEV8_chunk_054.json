  "text": "But unlike biology, where the thing they're doing and the communications they're expressing are very tightly linked, what these things are doing may have very little to do with their intrinsic motivations In other words, just like in that sorting algorithm, we make it sort, but the intrinsic motivation that it has to do other things has nothing to do with the sorting itself And so we could really be fooled by the fact that the These things speak I think language may be maybe sort of a red herring as far as what any of these things are actually doing And so these AIs, I don't think they have anything resembling a human mind, but that doesn't matter, neither does your liver These things have other kinds of minds And by creating these sorts of interfaces, we may be fishing in a new area of that space that has never had embodiments before And that's a different way of thinking about it than this idea that you are creating a new intelligence whose cognition is described by the language that it speaks I think these two things might be very decoupled And I think that ultimately we might end up talking about freedom, not about predictability or determinism, but really about the quality of the ingressions that are operating at this, at this other level between chance and necessity And I think in the future we need to focus less on emergence and as merely a catalog of surprises that we didn't expect, but a systematic study of the structure of that latent space of patterns of form and behavior, and to really try to work out that relationship between the structure of the physical pointer, meaning the embodiment, and the patterns that are coming through it",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the nature of artificial intelligence, suggesting that it may not resemble human cognition but could still have its own kind of 'mind'. They propose a shift in focus from predictability and determinism to the quality of 'ingressions', and a systematic study of patterns of form and behavior, and their relationship to physical embodiment.",
