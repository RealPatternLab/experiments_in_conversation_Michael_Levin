  "text": "This is not the end There are a number of interesting things that can happen after that, and we can talk about that But I think that developmental biology offers no special point when any of the things that are of interest to this group kick in There is no special stage at which some sort of discrete thing happens At least I'm not aware of any such The other important thing about the architecture of which remain is that we are all collecting collective intelligences We are all made of parts that are themselves Quite competent So here's a single cell",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the continuous nature of developmental biology, emphasizing that there is no specific stage where a discrete event occurs. They also highlight the concept of collective intelligences, suggesting that each cell within an organism is competent and contributes to the overall biological architecture.",
