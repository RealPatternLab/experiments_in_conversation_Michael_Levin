  "text": "So we as humans are obsessed with three dimensional space We are pretty good at recognizing medium sized objects moving at medium speeds in that space And so these kinds of things are pretty easy for us to understand However, biology has been navigating other spaces long before we had nerve and muscle that allowed us to explore the three dimensional world So living things navigate transcriptional space, they navigate physiological state spaces and they navigate anatomical morphospace, which is basically the journey that we took during embryogenesis, from being a single cell to whatever body shape we have now And so my point is that there are unconventional beings that are doing this perception action loop They have competency at problem solving, they strive for specific, specific goals They, they, I think they, they, they, they, they, they suffer and they do various, various things that we would find very relevant to this problem in spaces that we can't see And that is, that is critical Just like in the, in the case of the electromagnetism, that means that we need to, the, it's on us actually the responsibility is on us to develop tools to be able to recognize and, and think about the lives and the inner lives in particular of beings that live in spaces that we are not evolutionarily prepped for",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of perception in biological entities, emphasizing that living organisms navigate through transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical spaces. He suggests that these entities have problem-solving abilities and goal orientation, and that humans need to develop tools to understand these 'inner lives' that exist in spaces not typically perceived by humans.",
