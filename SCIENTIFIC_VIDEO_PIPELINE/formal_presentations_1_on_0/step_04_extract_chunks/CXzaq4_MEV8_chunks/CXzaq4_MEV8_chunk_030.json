  "text": "So we have the ability to both read and write information into this electrical interface as you would in the brain when you do this And I could show you dozens of different examples I'll just show you one When you do this, you can communicate new goals For example, we can take RNA encoding, a particular potassium channel We can use that to establish a particular bioelectrical state somewhere in the early embryo And we have one here that encodes the message build an eye And when we do that in cells that are going to become gut, sure enough they get the message and they build an eye",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the ability to read and write information into an electrical interface, similar to processes in the brain. He provides an example of using RNA encoding a specific potassium channel to establish a bioelectrical state in an early embryo, which can communicate new developmental goals, such as instructing cells destined to become gut tissue to build an eye.",
