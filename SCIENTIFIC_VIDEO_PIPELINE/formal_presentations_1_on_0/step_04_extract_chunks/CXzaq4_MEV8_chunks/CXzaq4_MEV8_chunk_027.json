  "text": "This is highly conserved homologous machinery, not merely analogous, they are actually evolutionarily homologous And so for years now we've been operating on this hypothesis that we could also learn to do decoding, non neural decoding, to understand the goals, the preferences, the problem solving capacities of morphogenesis, of navigating not three dimensional spaces, which is what the nervous system does, but actually navigating anatomical space And so we have, we've developed tools to read the bioelectrical states here of individual cells So the colors represent voltage These are voltage sensitive dyes These are not models, these are simulations These are real, real biological data",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of evolutionary homology and its role in non-neural decoding for understanding morphogenesis. He also talks about the tools developed to read bioelectrical states of individual cells using voltage sensitive dyes, emphasizing that these are real biological data, not merely simulations.",
