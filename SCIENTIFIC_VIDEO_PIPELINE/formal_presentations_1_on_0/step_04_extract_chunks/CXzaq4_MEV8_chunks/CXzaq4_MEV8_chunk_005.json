  "text": "In other words, only a tiny region was available to us because of our own evolutionary history And I think this is exactly what's going on with our mind Blindness and our really inability to envision and to recognize all kinds of very diverse intelligence is all around us And I think we need to create these kinds of enabling technologies, much as we did here to, to enable us to recognize and interact with these other beings So this is, you know, this is, this is the sort of, the sort of picture that, that underlies a lot of thought in the field It's an, an old piece of art called Adam names the animals in the Garden of Eden And I think there's, there's something deeply wrong and then also something deeply correct about this, this, this, this, this view What's wrong here is that it suggests that there are very clearly delineated natural kinds",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the limitations of human perception due to our evolutionary history, which hinders our ability to recognize diverse forms of intelligence. They suggest the need for enabling technologies to interact with these diverse intelligences. The speaker also critiques the traditional view of clearly delineated 'natural kinds', as depicted in a piece of art.",
