  "text": "So in my framework, What I try to do is create a way of thinking about all of these different agents, no matter what their composition or province is In other words, we need to be able to think about familiar creatures like primates and birds and maybe an octopus and a whale and things like that, but also very weird creatures, such as colonial organisms, engineered new life forms, of which I'm going to show You1today AIs, whether purely software or robotic, maybe someday exobiological agents, and even something that I won't have time to talk about today, which is even weirder still, which are actually patterns within media I would like to have a way of understanding what all of these agents have in common and in particular in the way that moves experimental work forward",
