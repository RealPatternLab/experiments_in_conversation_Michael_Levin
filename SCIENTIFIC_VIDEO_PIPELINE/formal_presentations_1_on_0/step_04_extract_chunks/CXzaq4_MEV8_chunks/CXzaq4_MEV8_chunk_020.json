  "text": "I'll show you a little bit of that Just a couple of things to point out some interesting ways in which the collective intelligence of cells as it navigates morphospace is doing all of the things that we usually take to be pretty relevant evidence for consciousness First of all, it has this really interesting top down control structure where higher level goal states eventually trickle down and control the molecular biology of what happens in the tissue Here's an example Regenerative amphibians such as this axolotl What happens is if you take a tail like this and you graft it to the flank here, what happens is, so here it is grafted Over time this thing will turn into limb",

An example of regenerative biology is given through the axolotl, where a grafted tail can transform into a limb over time.",
