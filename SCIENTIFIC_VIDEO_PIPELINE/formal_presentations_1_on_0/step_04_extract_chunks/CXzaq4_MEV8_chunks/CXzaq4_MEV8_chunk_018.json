  "text": "So the next thing I'm going to very briefly talk about is one model system that we study, which is the collective intelligence of morphogenesis And this is typically what I'd spend 45 minutes just on this part and not do any of these other things But I think it's important for us And the reason that it's important is that it allows us, it allows us to start to think about how it is that we might first of all extend ideas from a cognitive and behavioral science to other substrates and then how we can actually in a very practical way communicate with these beings and discover new science",
