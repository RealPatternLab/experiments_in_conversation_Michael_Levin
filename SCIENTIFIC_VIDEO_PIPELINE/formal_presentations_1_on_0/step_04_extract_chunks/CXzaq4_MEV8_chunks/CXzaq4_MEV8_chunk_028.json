  "text": "This is a frog embryo We can see all the electrical activity that's, that's going on So you can, we're scanning this thing the way that you might, you might scan a brain We do lots of quantitative simulation to try to understand at multiple levels of description how these dynamics are changing all the way from the molecular biology to tissue level dynamics, to trying to link them with ideas in connection is connectionist machine learning and also dynamical system systems theory and things like that to try to understand pattern completion So regeneration as pattern completion and so on",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the bioelectricity in a frog embryo, using scanning and quantitative simulation to understand the changing dynamics from molecular biology to tissue level. The speaker also attempts to link these dynamics with connectionist machine learning and dynamical systems theory, particularly in the context of pattern completion and regeneration.",
