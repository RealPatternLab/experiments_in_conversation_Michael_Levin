  "text": "And I think in the future we need to focus less on emergence and as merely a catalog of surprises that we didn't expect, but a systematic study of the structure of that latent space of patterns of form and behavior, and to really try to work out that relationship between the structure of the physical pointer, meaning the embodiment, and the patterns that are coming through it And I think xenobots and anthrobots and various other tools, including language models and so on, are exploration vehicles Because pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material, software, and these patterns which affect all of them are viable beings and cyborgs and hybrids And these are the kinds of things that are really going to challenge our notions of consciousness And if we're going to have an ethical synth biosis with these things, we have to get better at understanding minds outside of our normal embodiment And this is what I think the future Garden of Eden is going to look like It's gonna be a very weird place, but this is all coming I mean, it's not going to take long before we're surrounded by beings that are radically different I'm going to skip all this and just to say that if you're interested in any of these things, there are papers where we go into this in detail And the most important thing is to thank the postdocs and the students who did the work, our amazing collaborators, our funders here that have supported this work over the years And there are three disclosures These are companies that have licensed some of our stuff for various purposes",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the need to focus on the systematic study of emergence in developmental biology, particularly the relationship between the structure of physical pointers and the patterns that emerge. They suggest that xenobots, anthrobots, and language models are tools for exploring this field. The speaker also anticipates a future where bio-engineered beings challenge our understanding of consciousness and embodiment.",
