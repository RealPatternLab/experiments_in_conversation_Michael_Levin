  "text": "So this process of creative confabulation, forward looking, not just a recall of static information, but forward looking reinterpretation of whatever you have I think in our, in our brain, our ability to do this comes from this ancient need to re expand your The genetic information that you've been given as opposed to sort of obey it in some sort of rote fashion And this is why living things can do amazing They have incredible plasticity I won't have time to go into this in detail But basically, if you want to, if you want to make a kidney lumen and you happen to be given normal size cells, this is what you do Cell to cell communication, 8 to 10 cells build a thing If you're given these enormous cells that you've never seen before",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of creative confabulation in relation to the reinterpretation of genetic information, suggesting that this ability stems from an ancient need to expand beyond the given genetic information. The speaker also touches on the plasticity of living things, particularly in the context of cell-to-cell communication and the construction of a kidney lumen.",
