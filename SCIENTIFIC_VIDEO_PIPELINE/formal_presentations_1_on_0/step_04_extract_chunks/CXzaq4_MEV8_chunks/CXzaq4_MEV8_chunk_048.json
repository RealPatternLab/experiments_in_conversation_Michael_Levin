  "text": "But also it contains more complex active patterns that behavior science, behavioral scientists would recognize as kinds of minds And so what, what I, what I think is happening is that the relationship between mind and body is basically the same relationship as between truths of mathematics and physical objects, because that space contains not just mathematical facts, but actually behavioral propensities or kinds of minds And so there are two implications to this First of all that I think that whatever we build, be it machines, robots, biobots, embryos, bodies, organs, whatever we build, these are basically interfaces They're front ends They're like thin clients for these patterns that ingress into the physical world and have a huge impact on what actually happens And I think, well, the first implication is that biologicals are not the only interfaces for this I think this stuff is pervasive I think it goes all the way down to the bottom It is not just the biological bodies that have the, the advantage of being able to host these kind of patterns And I also think that we are really bad as the scientific community is really bad at predicting what is going to ingress when you make these kinds of things And I'll briefly mention an example in a minute, but I think this is very important for the status of AIs and all this kind of stuff, because I do not believe that we make intelligence either biological or technological I think that what we, we make our interfaces that basically enable some of these patterns to come into the physical world",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the relationship between mind and body, likening it to the relationship between mathematical truths and physical objects. They propose that all creations, including machines, robots, and biological entities, are interfaces for patterns that influence the physical world. The speaker also suggests that the scientific community struggles to predict the outcomes of these interfaces, particularly in the context of Artificial Intelligence.",
