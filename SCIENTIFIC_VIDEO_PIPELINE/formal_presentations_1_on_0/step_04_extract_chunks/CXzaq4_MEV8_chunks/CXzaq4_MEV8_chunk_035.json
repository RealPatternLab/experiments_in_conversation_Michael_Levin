  "text": "This is not Photoshop or AI or anything This is exactly what they look like But notice something very interesting This bioelectrical map is not a map of this two headed animal It is a map of this anatomically one headed animal In fact, the molecular biology is normal So anterior markers in the head, not in the tail So what you're looking at here is the fact that a single body can hold at least one of two different representations of what a correct planarian will look like In fact, this is a counterfactual representation because this is not true right now",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the bioelectrical map of a planarian, which interestingly does not match its physical, one-headed anatomy. He emphasizes that a single body can hold multiple representations of its form, and refers to this as a 'counterfactual representation'.",
