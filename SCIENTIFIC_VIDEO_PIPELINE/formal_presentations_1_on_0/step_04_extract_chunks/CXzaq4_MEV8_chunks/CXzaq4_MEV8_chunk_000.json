  "text": "What I'm going to do today is give a very different talk than what I usually do Nicholas asked me to kind of be, you know, get on the edge more And so I'm going to do that today Typically, I'd spend about 45 minutes on the biology and either not mention consciousness at all or mention it, you know, a little bit at the end And so I've sort of flipped that And a large part of what I normally discuss on the biology end I'm going to skip And we can talk about it in Q and A or you can find it in, at this, at this, at our lab website here or many other places And so, you know, it's, it's a little intimidating to be talking about consciousness to people who are experts in, in the field because typically my lab does not work on consciousness per se We work on different aspects of unconventional intelligence",
