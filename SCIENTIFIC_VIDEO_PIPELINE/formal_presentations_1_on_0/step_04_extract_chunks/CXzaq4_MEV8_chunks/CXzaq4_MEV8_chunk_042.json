  "text": "So clearly I don't think that I think applying these methods here is quite informative Now, they have all sorts of interesting behavioral capacities For example, if you give them loose epithelial cells, what they do is they run around and they collect them into little balls And because they themselves are working with an agential material, these little balls mature to be the next generation of xenobots Guess what they do They run around and they make the next generation, which makes the next, and so on So we call this kinematic replication As far as we know, no other creature on earth reproduces this way It's a little bit like von Neumann's dream of a robot that makes copies of itself from stuff it finds in the environment We certainly didn't teach them to do that",
