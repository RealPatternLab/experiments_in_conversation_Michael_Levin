  "text": "In other words, it's had empirical fertility, not a question of philosophy or linguistics, but actually of discovering new things And so I think that's actually quite useful and helps us to think about very diverse kinds of minds in other embodiments I also think that if you use any of the typical criteria that we use to ascribe consciousness to each other, be they joint cellular mechanisms or problem solving, observable behaviors or evolutionary relationships, or maybe you like microtubule dynamics or specific kinds of causal architectures as evidence of consciousness in each other Then for the exact same reasons, we are going to have to take very, very seriously the possibility of consciousness in our other body structures And that is basically a stepping stone to asking more broadly what other kinds of very diverse embodiments could be relevant to the study of consciousness",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of consciousness, not just from a philosophical or linguistic perspective, but also from a biological standpoint. He suggests that if we use the same criteria to ascribe consciousness to each other, such as cellular mechanisms, problem solving, and observable behaviors, we should also consider the possibility of consciousness in other body structures and diverse embodiments.",
