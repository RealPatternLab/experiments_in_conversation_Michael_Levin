  "text": "So, so, so first I'm going to talk about the framework, the approach that we take to these kinds of problems And, and I think it's really analogous to what's happened in our understanding of electromagnetism You know, prior to having a good theory of electromagnetism, first of all, we had all kinds of diverse phenomena, static electricity, lightning, light, magnets and so on that people thought were fundamentally different things And so having a good theory allowed us to see that no, they're actually different aspects of the same underlying thing And also it enabled us to create technologies that allow us to operate at areas of this, of the spectrum to which we were previously completely blind and unable to participate",
