  "text": "But then there has to be a process of, if you want to use those memories of interpretation And this has to be creative I don't think it's algorithmic, at least this end is because you've lost information, you don't exactly know what your memories mean And I think this is a critical part of being a conscious agent, is being in charge of constantly reinterpreting your own memories Maybe the same way they were interpreted before, but maybe not And all of this is described in detail here But notice that living bodies face the exact same problem We get squeezed down into a bottleneck, which is the egg, and then we have to decode And under normal circumstances, the decoding goes exactly the way the encoding went, but it doesn't have to And this is why anthrobots and xenobots and various chimeras and all kinds of weird things that we can make work Because this is a creative interpretation process There is no allegiance to what the information meant before you tell the best, most adaptive story you can tell now",
