  "text": "So just by virtue of the mathematics that governs collections of, of chemicals that turn each other on or off, you find that these kind of systems have at least six different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning So and, and we're using all this in the lab for all kinds of interesting biomedical applications such as drug conditioning But you can, you can actually train the material that is inside the cells themselves So what I'm painting here is a picture of a, of a collective intelligence stack where the material, I've called it an agential material, it goes all the way to the bottom of collections of chemical networks that have behaviors that would be recognized by people who work on, in behavioral science And in fact this is a very recent data In fact, it turns out that as you train these things, their causal emergence goes up",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of cellular learning and Pavlovian conditioning within biochemical networks. He introduces the idea of 'agential material', suggesting a form of collective intelligence within these networks. He also mentions the increase in causal emergence as these systems are trained, hinting at potential biomedical applications.",
