  "text": "In other words, God couldn't do it, the angels couldn't do it It had to be Adam that named them And in these old traditions, the idea of naming something means that you've discovered its true inner nature, right That's the kind of the deep meaning of giving something a name And I think this is profound for us because I think we are going to have to name, in this sense of discovering the inner nature, a whole variety of novel beings with whom we are going to share our world And so I think that's just as was true for Adam And so I think we're trying to develop some tools for making that easier to do One important thing that I think is true is that because of our understanding of evolution and embryonic development, that we're on different timescales We all start as a single cell, and then we become this typical human that features prominently in philosophical discussions of philosophy of mind We now know that this is a slow and gradual process on both timescales And so I would claim that the continuity thesis is the null hypothesis That is, if If we think there should be some sort of emergent phase transitions and specific categories that are just different than other categories of beings here, that is what needs very strong evidence The baseline, I think, in the null hypothesis should be a continuity and the drive to develop models of scaling so that we can talk about what kind of consciousness and how much, not whether something is or isn't consciousness And I'll sort of hammer this theme a couple of times in my talk now Moreover Whoa, sorry",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of naming and discovering the inner nature of beings, drawing parallels to embryonic development and evolution. They propose the continuity thesis as the null hypothesis, suggesting that consciousness is a continuous and gradual process, rather than being categorized into distinct phases or states.",
