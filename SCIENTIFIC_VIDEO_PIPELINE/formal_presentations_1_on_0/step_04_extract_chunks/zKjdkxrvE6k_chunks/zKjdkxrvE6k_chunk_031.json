  "text": "So what I'm really interested in are patterns that don't have a history and they don't have an explanation in terms of physics. And what could that possibly be? So, so here's one example. This thing is called a Halley plot and there's a million examples. I just like these. It's called a Hali plot. You get it? It's a fractal that you get from plotting this very simple formula, this tiny little seed in complex number Z. If you unpack, it gives you this. And if you slowly change one of these numbers, what you'll get are videos and movies of all this kind of stuff.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses his interest in patterns that lack a history or explanation in terms of physics. He introduces the concept of a Halley plot, a fractal derived from plotting a simple formula in complex number Z. He emphasizes that changing one of these numbers can result in a variety of visual outputs.",
