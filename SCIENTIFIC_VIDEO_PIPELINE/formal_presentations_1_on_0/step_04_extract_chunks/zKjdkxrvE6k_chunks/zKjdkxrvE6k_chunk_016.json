  "text": "But if you leave them in the barium, what happens is that a little while later they will make a new head And the new head is completely fine with barium, no problem It's barium adapted When you check what is different about the original head and the barium adapted head, you find that it's, it's only, it's, it's less than a dozen genes that are different And the trick is that these guys, planaria, have never seen barium either These worms, nor in their evolutionary history, there's never been selection for knowing what to do when you get hit with barium",

The new head is adapted to barium, with less than a dozen genes differing from the original. This adaptation is remarkable as planaria have no evolutionary history of barium exposure.",
