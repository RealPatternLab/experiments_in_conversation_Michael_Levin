  "text": "So I'm very interested in this kind of stuff When we make novel beings, whether technological hybrids or biological and cyborgs and augmented Humans, all kinds of weird stuff that is already partially in existence What else I mean, these, you know, these things, these things here don't really necessarily have a history of selection for specific properties Where else are they getting these goals if it's not Where do these patterns come from if it's not selection And by the way, one story I didn't show you is that there is an anatomical space There are these attractors that correspond to different species shapes And we can actually show that the same genetic hardware can actually visit multiple attractors It doesn't have to go to its species specific attractor, but, but they're there And then people will say, well, okay, fine, so these are shaped by evolution",

They also mention the concept of anatomical space and species-specific attractors, suggesting that the same genetic hardware can visit multiple attractors.",
