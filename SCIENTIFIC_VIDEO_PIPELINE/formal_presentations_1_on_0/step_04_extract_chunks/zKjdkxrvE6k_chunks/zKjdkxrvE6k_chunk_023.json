  "text": "So you have here something like the paradox of change, where if you as a biological organism or a lineage, if you stay the same, you will surely die when the circumstances change. But if you change to fit those circumstances, in a sense, you, meaning the old you, is still gone. How do you persist? You cannot persist in place. That's the, that seems to be the paradox. So what I like to think about is this idea that your memories, and these are memories, these are both cognitive memories and genetic memories are just messages from, from your past self.",

He proposes the concept of cognitive and genetic memories as messages from the past self as a means of persistence.",
