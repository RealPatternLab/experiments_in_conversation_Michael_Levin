  "text": "So what the biology is optimizing for is not fidelity of information, it's saliency So you're not trying to keep the caterpillar memories as they are, you're trying to remap them to a new meaning and new functions So the same thing is happening in, so that's the cognitive side, the same thing is happening in the developmental side when you have a genome And I know I didn't have time to go through all these examples, probably you can find some of the stuff in this paper But the idea basically is this, that you come into the world with a certain genome",
