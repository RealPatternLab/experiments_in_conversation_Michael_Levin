  "text": "So what the biology is optimizing for is not fidelity of information, it's saliency. So you're not trying to keep the caterpillar memories as they are, you're trying to remap them to a new meaning and new functions. So the same thing is happening in, so that's the cognitive side, the same thing is happening in the developmental side when you have a genome. And I know I didn't have time to go through all these examples, probably you can find some of the stuff in this paper. But the idea basically is this, that you come into the world with a certain genome.",
