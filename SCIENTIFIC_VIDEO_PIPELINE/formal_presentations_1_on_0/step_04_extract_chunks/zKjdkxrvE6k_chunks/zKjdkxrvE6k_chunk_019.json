  "text": "Now here are a couple of amazing parts. First of all, this is a completely different molecular mechanism. So instead of cell to cell communication and tubulogenesis, here, this is cytoskeletal bending. So, so what the system is doing is what you would do on an IQ test. You use various tools at your disposal to get to the, to solve the problem, to get to the same goal in novel ways beyond what you would normally do. Right. It's creative use of the tools that you already have. And think about what this means from the perspective of the system. You come into the world, what can you count on? Well, you can't count on your environment, we all know that.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses a new molecular mechanism involving cytoskeletal bending, contrasting it with traditional cell communication and tubulogenesis. They compare this to problem-solving on an IQ test, using available tools in creative ways. The speaker also touches on the concept of environmental unpredictability.",
