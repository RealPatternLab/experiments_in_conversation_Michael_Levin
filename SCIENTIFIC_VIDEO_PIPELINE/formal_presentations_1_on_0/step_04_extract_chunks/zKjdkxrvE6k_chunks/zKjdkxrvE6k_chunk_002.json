  "text": "So I like philosophical ideas that end up being computational models and then end up being applications and eventually therapeutics And this is why part of the lab does birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer and so on, because then we know we're on the right track And in particular, again, what I don't have time to do today, but what I do, I've just sort of made a recent talk about All of this is similar to what happened to different kinds of numbers where we slowly, with certain kinds of schisms and people sort of freaking out when they discover certain new kinds of numbers we've kind of enlarged Even though some of these sets are infinite, we've discovered novel degrees of infinity and new kinds of numbers I think the same thing is happening and going to happen more with the sets of cognitive agents that are out there And so we all can recognize this, some of us are okay with this, or even this",
