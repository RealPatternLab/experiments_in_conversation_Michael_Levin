  "text": "So on the surface of it, the crazy thing here to think about is, well, how do you maintain information while you're drastically refactoring the substrate Okay, and so that's a cool question, but there's a better, there's an even more amazing piece to this, which is that the actual memories of the caterpillar are of absolutely no use to the butterfly The butterfly doesn't crawl, it doesn't eat leaves, it wants nectar The memories of the caterpillar, if they were trying to stay intact, would never survive But if they are able to be remapped onto a new architecture, not just carried over, not just persist, but actually change, remap, then they survive into this new embodiment as the creature gains a new life in a higher dimensional space",

Despite the drastic changes in physical form and lifestyle, certain memories survive by being remapped onto a new 'architecture'.",
