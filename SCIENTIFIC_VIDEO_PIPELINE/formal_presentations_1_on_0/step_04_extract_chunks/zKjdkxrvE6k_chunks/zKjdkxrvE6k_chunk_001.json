  "text": "So what I'm interested in is to address something that I think we have, which is a degree of mind blindness And it's an analogy You can think about this as the electromagnetic spectrum It used to be back in the day that things that happen when you wave magnets around, light, X rays, all of those things were thought to be very, very different things Actually, could we mute somebody Somebody's Yep, there we go Thank you And, and something, something really interesting happened when we ended up with a proper theory of electromagnetism, which is that first of all, phenomena that were thought to be extremely different turned out to be manifestations of the same thing And so we, we, we have an idea for how they relate to each other And it allowed a technology to be made that enables us to detect and interact with and make use of all kinds of things that were completely inaccessible to us with our natural set of senses And so I think something like that is happening with cognition, where evolution has given us some firmware that enables us to recognize certain extremely narrow range of kinds of minds And I think we need to develop theory and that will lead to practical tools to enable us to recognize, create, and ethically relate to a very wide, diverse set of intelligences, regardless of how they got here or what they're made of And so we're interested in my group, in understanding how to relate to all of these kinds of weird things And in particular very important to move experimental work forward",
