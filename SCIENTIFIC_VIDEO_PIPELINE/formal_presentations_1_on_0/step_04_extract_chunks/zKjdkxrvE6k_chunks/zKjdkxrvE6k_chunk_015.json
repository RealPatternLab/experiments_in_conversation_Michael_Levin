  "text": "So the space of possible anatomical configurations And they don't just roll down hills and automatically sort of do the same thing every single time They are really navigating with some amazing capabilities The kind of problem solving that they do is, is astounding I'm just going to show you two examples We could talk about this for hours And I think really important for us to understand in order to make real artificial intelligence and things like that So here's just one example You take this planaria, these flatworms, you put them in a solution of barium chloride Barium is a non specific potassium channel blocker It makes their cells very unhappy Their heads explode Literally over the next 24 hours, they're heads explode",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complex problem-solving capabilities of organisms, specifically planaria (flatworms), and how understanding these can contribute to the development of artificial intelligence. An experiment is mentioned where planaria are exposed to barium chloride, a potassium channel blocker, resulting in a dramatic cellular response.",
