  "text": "So the space of possible anatomical configurations. And they don't just roll down hills and automatically sort of do the same thing every single time. They are really navigating with some amazing capabilities. The kind of problem solving that they do is, is astounding. I'm just going to show you two examples. We could talk about this for hours. And I think really important for us to understand in order to make real artificial intelligence and things like that. So here's just one example. You take this planaria, these flatworms, you put them in a solution of barium chloride. Barium is a non specific potassium channel blocker. It makes their cells very unhappy. Their heads explode. Literally over the next 24 hours, they're heads explode.",
