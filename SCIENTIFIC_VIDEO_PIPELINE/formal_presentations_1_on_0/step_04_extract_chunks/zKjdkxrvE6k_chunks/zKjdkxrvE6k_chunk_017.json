  "text": "So just think about this, this problem You've got an, you've got an extreme physiological stressor You have on the order of 20,000 control knobs that you can, that you can, that you can twist So like a Moravic bush, you know, with, with, with an incredible number of effectors, which of these genes do you turn on enough to solve a novel, a novel stressor It's kind of like being in a nuclear reactor control room The thing's melting down And unless you know exactly how it works, unless you have a model of your own apparatus, what you don't have time to do is to start flipping switches randomly to see if life gets better because you'll be dead And there's no time for that",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexity of managing physiological stressors, comparing it to controlling a nuclear reactor. They emphasize the importance of understanding the system (i.e., the body's bioelectric mechanisms) to effectively regulate genes and respond to stressors, rather than randomly 'flipping switches'.",
