  "text": "So just think about this, this problem. You've got an, you've got an extreme physiological stressor. You have on the order of 20,000 control knobs that you can, that you can, that you can twist. So like a Moravic bush, you know, with, with, with an incredible number of effectors, which of these genes do you turn on enough to solve a novel, a novel stressor? It's kind of like being in a nuclear reactor control room. The thing's melting down. And unless you know exactly how it works, unless you have a model of your own apparatus, what you don't have time to do is to start flipping switches randomly to see if life gets better because you'll be dead. And there's no time for that.",
