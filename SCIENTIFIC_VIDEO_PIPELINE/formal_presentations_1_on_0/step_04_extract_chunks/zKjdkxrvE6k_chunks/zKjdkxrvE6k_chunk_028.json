  "text": "First that, that was the case physiologically, then, you know, genetically and developmentally, and then eventually, you know, conventional cognition And again, all of this, all of this is here One of the cool things about it is that this gives rise to an interesting intelligence, ratchet So the more creative interpretation of your genome you do during development, the harder it is for selection to actually know whether your genome was any good or not And we've done simulations of this to show that what happens when you evolve over a competent material like this is that the pressure on the structural genome comes off and all of the work of evolution starts being done on the actual algorithm of, of the creative interpretation of the tools that you have Because with each sort of run through that loop, it becomes harder and harder to select better genomes because you can't see them You can just see the fact that useful phenotypes had appeared And so I think that ratchet started very early on, and it contributes to the amazing, you know, sort of conventional intelligence that we see in the, in the animal world Okay, and so the last part, just, just maybe two, two minutes more, the last part is this When we have these, when the, the systems that I showed you, when I talk about problem solving, what I've, what I've been showing you are systems that can get to their goal by different means",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of creative genome interpretation during development, which makes it difficult for selection to evaluate the quality of the genome. This leads to a shift in evolutionary pressure from the structural genome to the algorithm of genome interpretation. The speaker also mentions how this process contributes to the emergence of intelligence in the animal world.",
