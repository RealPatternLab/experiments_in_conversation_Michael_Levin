  "text": "This is one frame. What you're seeing here is you're reading out the memories inside the collective intelligence that's navigating that anatomical space. This is the memory, this is the face. So here's where the mouth is going to go, here's where the right eye is going to be. Here are the placodes. This is what guides the downstream gene expression and the anatomy to form a proper face. This is how. This, when you ask how do the cells know what to do? This is how they know what to do. This is their memory. And that bioelectric pattern is not just for bundling together cells to form a single embryo. It actually connects multiple embryos together.",
