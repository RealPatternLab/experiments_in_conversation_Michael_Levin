  "text": "But, but clearly there are, there are patterns that come from, from at least mathematics that, that do not have the conventional kind of explanation that biological patterns have. So how much of this is actually relevant to biology? So, so, so biologists hate this idea because they want a nice kind of sparse ontology where you have, you have the physical world and that's it. And they don't want any, you know, any, any weird stuff. But I think a lot of mathematicians are actually pretty comfortable that what they're doing is exploring a completely different world that is not in fact explained by any fact of Physics, it matters for physics.",
