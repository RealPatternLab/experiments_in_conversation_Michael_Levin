  "text": "So what we're seeing here is that there are a variety of computational systems at all levels of organization And I don't have time to talk about all the cool things that the genetic networks are doing They can learn too You don't even need cells, just the molecular networks alone have six different kinds of memory, including Pavlovian conditioning But all of these things work together and they solve problems in various spaces And as I mentioned before, we are tuned to recognize medium sized objects moving at medium speeds in three dimensional space And so crows and primates and maybe a whale or an octopus, we can sort of get that",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexity of computational systems in biology, focusing on the capabilities of genetic networks. These networks, even at the molecular level, are capable of learning and memory, including Pavlovian conditioning. The speaker also touches on the ability of certain animals to perceive medium-sized objects moving in three-dimensional space.",
