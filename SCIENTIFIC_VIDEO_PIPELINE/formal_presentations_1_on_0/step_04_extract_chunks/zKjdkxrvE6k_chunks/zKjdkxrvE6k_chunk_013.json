  "text": "So what we're seeing here is that there are a variety of computational systems at all levels of organization. And I don't have time to talk about all the cool things that the genetic networks are doing. They can learn too. You don't even need cells, just the molecular networks alone have six different kinds of memory, including Pavlovian conditioning. But all of these things work together and they solve problems in various spaces. And as I mentioned before, we are tuned to recognize medium sized objects moving at medium speeds in three dimensional space. And so crows and primates and maybe a whale or an octopus, we can sort of get that.",
