  "text": "But future you has to decompress them. And information was lost here. You don't actually know what these memories mean. When you find a particular memory molecule or a set of electrical states in your brain, you don't actually know what they mean. You have to creatively interpret them. And I suspect that while this part can be algorithmic and deductive, this part I don't think can. I suspect this is, and I don't exactly know what this is, I'll speculate a little bit at the end, but there's something else going on here which allows, allows those memories to be remapped in a novel context. Like every memory, every message from others at the current time, messages from past, you also need to be interpreted. And you don't need to really care about what they meant before. What you do need to care about is how do I make them adaptive now?",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexities of interpreting memories and the electrical states in the brain, suggesting that this process may not be purely algorithmic or deductive. They propose that memories are remapped and interpreted in new contexts, with an emphasis on making them adaptive to current situations.",
