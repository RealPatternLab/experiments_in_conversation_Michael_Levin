  "text": "But future you has to decompress them And information was lost here You don't actually know what these memories mean When you find a particular memory molecule or a set of electrical states in your brain, you don't actually know what they mean You have to creatively interpret them And I suspect that while this part can be algorithmic and deductive, this part I don't think can I suspect this is, and I don't exactly know what this is, I'll speculate a little bit at the end, but there's something else going on here which allows, allows those memories to be remapped in a novel context Like every memory, every message from others at the current time, messages from past, you also need to be interpreted And you don't need to really care about what they meant before What you do need to care about is how do I make them adaptive now",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexity of memory interpretation, emphasizing that understanding the meaning of specific memory molecules or bioelectric states in the brain requires creative interpretation. The speaker also suggests that memories need to be adaptively remapped in new contexts, rather than focusing on their original meanings.",
