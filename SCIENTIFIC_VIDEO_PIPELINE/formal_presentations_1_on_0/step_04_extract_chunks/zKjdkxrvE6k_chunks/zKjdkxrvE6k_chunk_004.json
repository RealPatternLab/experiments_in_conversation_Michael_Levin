  "text": "This is the journey that each of us takes from physics and chemistry which describe this quiescent oocyte That's how we all start life eventually, through this slow, gradual, continuous process No magic lightning flashes that suddenly push us into the realm of psychology and so on Eventually we end up being something like this This is what we're made of These are single cells They're extremely I mean this is a free living organism But you can see in a single cell, no brain, no nervous system, it has all kinds of capacities to pursue its own tiny little goals And then life normally goes this way It can take some twists and turns, it can have a breakdown of Multicellularity, a kind of dissociative identity disorder of the collective intelligence that gives rise to cancer It can also, with our help, go into new directions, such as these anthrobots, which can continue life even after a patient has died And we can talk about all that And what fundamentally happens to bring us into the world is alignment and a kind of dynamic storytelling And what I mean by that is that when we look at an embryo, and there may be, let's say at an early stage, it's a sheet of 100,000 cells Why do we look at that and we say there's one embryo, what is there one of If there's 100,000 cells, what's there one of Well, what there's one of is a particular model, a commitment to travel in anatomical space to a particular location that describes whatever it is that's being built A human, a giraffe, snake, whatever And all of the cells are committed to this one story of what it is that they're building",
