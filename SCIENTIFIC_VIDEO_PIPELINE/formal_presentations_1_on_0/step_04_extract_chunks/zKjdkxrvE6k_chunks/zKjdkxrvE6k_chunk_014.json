  "text": "But what biology is teaching us is, is that embodiment is really not what we think. So when people say that a various kinds of AIs are not embodied because they don't roll around the room on wheels and they don't walk around that. I, I think that's actually not, not the right way to think about it at all. Because there's lots of perception, action loops and goal directedness and intelligence that take place in spaces that we cannot see. So your cells and your tissues are navigating a high dimensional space of possible gene expressions. They're navigating a space of physiological states. And of course what we study is morphous space, okay?",
