  "text": "So what you have here is then, is then alignment, both physical and functional, to a particular model of navigation of that space. Like any good collective intelligence, or any intelligence really, it can be. We can think about how reliably it does its job. Here are acorns, they make these oak leaves. We think that, okay, this is what the oak genome knows how to do, is direct the formation of exactly this pattern. It's incredibly reliable. They're very good at doing their job, these cells. But of course it's hackable. For example, this is an example of a non human bioengineer. This little wasp that comes around and deposits some signals, a kind of bioprompting that causes these cells to build something completely different. Right?",
