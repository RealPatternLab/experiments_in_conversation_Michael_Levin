  "text": "Well, it's a fact that holds in the physical world And, and that's that I prefer what I think is a more optimistic version, which is to say, much like the mathematicians is probably an ordered space of these things and we should have a research agenda to systematically investigate them And that the things that we're making, such as xenobots, anthrobots, various chimeras are, and some other crazy stuff such as minimal algorithms, are actually vehicles They're exploration vehicles that you can use to look for patterns in the latent space of possibilities and, and understand how those patterns come into the physical world and under what circumstances",
