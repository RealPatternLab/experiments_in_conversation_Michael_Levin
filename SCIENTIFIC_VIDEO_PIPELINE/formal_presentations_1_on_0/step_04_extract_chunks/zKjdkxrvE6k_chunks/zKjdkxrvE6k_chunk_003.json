  "text": "But actually it gets really weird. And this, I'm not prepared to talk much. We could touch on it, but I'm not prepared to talk much about this today. But we can certainly talk about this and the infinity of sentient forms. I think once we understand what we're looking at is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and we can think about for each of these things what is needed to be able to recognize these things. And then what does it break for our assumptions and then how do we do something useful? Okay, so the first section here is. I'm just going to show you a little bit of biology and this idea that what we call life are systems that self assemble into a multi scale competency architecture where every level has agendas and certain capabilities which explores problem spaces by aligning its parts towards larger and more diverse goals.",
