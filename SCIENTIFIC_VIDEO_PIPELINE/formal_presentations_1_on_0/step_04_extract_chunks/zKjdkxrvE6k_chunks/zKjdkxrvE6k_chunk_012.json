  "text": "But what happens is if you cut him, if you cut the tail, the head and the tail, that fragment is actually going to give rise to, we had an animal. And I now have to tell people, this is not AI, this is not, you know, Photoshop. These are real, real results. And what happens is because this is what enables the collective to know what to build and when to stop. So you can, you can read out these pattern memories if you continue to cut these two headed animals that the memory holds. It's a bioelectric memory. It is not controlled by the genetics. The genetics are totally wild type. Nothing has changed. Changes in the genome sequencing the genome will not tell you that these things have two heads. It will also not tell you that the whole lineage will have two heads because you can keep cutting them. And in fact, when they reproduce, they cut themselves in half on their own and then they regenerate. They will continue to be two headed. Here's a video. You can see what these guys are doing.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the phenomenon of animal regeneration, specifically focusing on how certain animals can regenerate into two-headed creatures. The speaker emphasizes that this is not a genetic trait, but rather a bioelectric memory that guides the regeneration process.",
