  "text": "So I know what this is and I know what it can do. I think we have to be extremely careful because I don't think anything is exactly what. What the algorithm or the materials say it is. That I don't think that's true for. For humans in terms of the laws of biochemistry, and I don't think it's true for machines because of the formal limitations of the algorithms that they're supposedly running. That's it. Here's just the summary of these ideas. We now have a research agenda for all of this stuff. I'd just like to thank the people who did all the work. These are the postdocs and the students in my group, and we have lots of collaborators. And I have to do a disclosure. There are three companies that I'm involved with.",
