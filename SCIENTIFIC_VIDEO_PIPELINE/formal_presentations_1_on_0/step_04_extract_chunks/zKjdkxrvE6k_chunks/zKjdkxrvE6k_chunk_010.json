  "text": "So it's a multi scale kind of phenomenon. If I poke this guy here, all of his friends, each one of these things is a separate embryo. It's a separate frog embryo. Each one of them finds out about it. You can poke this one here. Within some minutes they all find out about it. And here you can see some cells doing their thing. So once you start to read these, it's basically think of neural decoding, think of trying to read the electrophysiology of the brain and extract memories and preferences and so on. We can do the same thing in morphogenesis and we can start to manipulate it.",
