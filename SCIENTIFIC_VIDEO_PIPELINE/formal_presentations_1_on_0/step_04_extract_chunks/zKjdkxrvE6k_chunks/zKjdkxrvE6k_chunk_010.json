  "text": "So it's a multi scale kind of phenomenon If I poke this guy here, all of his friends, each one of these things is a separate embryo It's a separate frog embryo Each one of them finds out about it You can poke this one here Within some minutes they all find out about it And here you can see some cells doing their thing So once you start to read these, it's basically think of neural decoding, think of trying to read the electrophysiology of the brain and extract memories and preferences and so on We can do the same thing in morphogenesis and we can start to manipulate it",
