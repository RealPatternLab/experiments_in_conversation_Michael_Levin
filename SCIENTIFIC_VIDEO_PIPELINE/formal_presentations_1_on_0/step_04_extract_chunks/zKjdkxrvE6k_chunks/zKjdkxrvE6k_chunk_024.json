  "text": "So what you don't have access to at any given moment in time is the past. You have no idea what happened in the past. What you have are memory engrams, traces left in your brain and body that were constructed by your past selves. They were compressed, they were Generalized, they went through this bottleneck. So here are all the stuff that, I mean, all the computer science people will recognize this immediately. All the inputs and the different diverse experiences came through. They were compressed somehow into these, this very, this very thin substrate which are the engrams that people still fight about what that is.",
