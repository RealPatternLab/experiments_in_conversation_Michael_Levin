  "text": "So we need to understand how these living systems actually solve novel problems That they haven't seen before This is maybe my favorite example of all time This is a cross section through the kidney tubule of a salamander So normally 8 to 10 cells that make this thing up What you can do is you can make these newts with more copies of their genetic material So when you have more copies of their genetic material, so instead of 2N chromosomes, you can have 4N, 5N, 6N and so on When you do this, the cells get bigger, but the newt stays the same size Well, how can that be Well, it's because the cell, there's actually few fewer cells that make up the same structure The cells are bigger, but there's less of them Okay And then when you make the cells truly gigantic, what you find is that one cell will bend around itself like this and leave a space in the middle, same structure",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses how living systems, specifically the kidney tubule cells of a salamander, adapt to changes in genetic material. By increasing the number of chromosome copies, cells become larger but fewer in number, maintaining the same overall structure. When cells become extremely large, they can bend around themselves to maintain the same structure.",
