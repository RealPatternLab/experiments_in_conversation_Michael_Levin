  "text": "So we need to understand how these living systems actually solve novel problems. That they haven't seen before. This is maybe my favorite example of all time. This is a cross section through the kidney tubule of a salamander. So normally 8 to 10 cells that make this thing up. What you can do is you can make these newts with more copies of their genetic material. So when you have more copies of their genetic material, so instead of 2N chromosomes, you can have 4N, 5N, 6N and so on. When you do this, the cells get bigger, but the newt stays the same size. Well, how can that be? Well, it's because the cell, there's actually few fewer cells that make up the same structure. The cells are bigger, but there's less of them. Okay. And then when you make the cells truly gigantic, what you find is that one cell will bend around itself like this and leave a space in the middle, same structure.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses how living systems, specifically salamanders, adapt to novel problems. By increasing the number of chromosomes in salamander cells, the cells become larger while the overall size of the organism remains the same. This is due to fewer but larger cells making up the same structure. The cells can even bend around themselves to maintain the same structure when they become extremely large.",
