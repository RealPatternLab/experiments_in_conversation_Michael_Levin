  "text": "So while the normal flatworm has a very clear memory that it needs one head and one tail, so that when you cut it into pieces, every piece makes one head and one tail. We can change that, we can incept false memories into these things using optogenetics and pharmacology and various other means. And so now you can say, no, actually. And of course this is still messy, we're still working this out, but you can say no, actually, you should have two heads. And it's a perfectly normal one headed animal, right? There he is with the wrong internal representation of what a correct planarian should look like. It's a latent memory. In fact, it's a counterfactual because it's not true. Right now, right now he has one head.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the ability of flatworms to regenerate and the inherent 'memory' they possess of their original form. They explain how this memory can be manipulated using optogenetics and pharmacology to create a two-headed worm, challenging the worm's internal representation of its normal structure.",
