  "text": "So what's interesting here, and then you can, you can make all sorts of other things clearly clear. Complexity doesn't hurt that it's kind of organic looking as well. But what's interesting about it is that it does not have, at least to my knowledge, I'm not a mathematician, but to my knowledge it does not have an explanation in physics. It does not have an explanation of history. It was not evolved, it was not selected. Is, it is in some way indexed into by this tiny little, little seed or pointer. I don't, I don't think you can call it a compression for reasons we can, we can talk about.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the complexity and organic nature of certain biological structures, which, to their knowledge, cannot be explained by physics or evolutionary history. The speaker also mentions the concept of 'indexing' by a 'seed' or 'pointer', and dismisses the idea of calling it 'compression'.",
