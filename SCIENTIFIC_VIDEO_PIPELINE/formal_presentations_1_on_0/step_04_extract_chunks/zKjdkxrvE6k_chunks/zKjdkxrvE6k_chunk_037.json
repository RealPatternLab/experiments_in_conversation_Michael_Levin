  "text": "So, so, so, so, so this is, this is my current hypothesis. And certainly other people have, have put out versions of this in the past. But the idea is that I think we now have actual tools that we can begin to, to study this and to figure out why it is that the frog genome doesn't just point to frog morphologies, but actually it knows how to make many different things that it pulls down. And so what I think are, is that the Platonic space doesn't just contain things that mathematicians like, such as facts about prime numbers and such, but also things that we would recognize as kinds of minds, in other words, behavioral patterns and capabilities. And what we make when we make, when, when we perceive, produce embryos, xenobots, computers, pretty much anything. You're not really making these kinds of things. What you're doing is making pointers that allow the ingression of specific patterns from that space into the physical world. And our job is to understand the relationship between the pointers and the thing they bring down. And okay, I'm going to stop because I already run way out of time.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, presents his hypothesis that the genome, using the frog as an example, has the ability to create a variety of morphologies, not just those specific to the frog. He suggests that this is due to the existence of a 'Platonic space' that contains not just mathematical concepts but also 'minds', or behavioral patterns. The creation of embryos, xenobots, and computers are seen as 'pointers' that allow specific patterns from this Platonic space to manifest in the physical world.",
