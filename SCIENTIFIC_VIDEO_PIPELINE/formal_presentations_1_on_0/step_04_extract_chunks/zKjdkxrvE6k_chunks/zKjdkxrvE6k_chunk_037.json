  "text": "So, so, so, so, so this is, this is my current hypothesis And certainly other people have, have put out versions of this in the past But the idea is that I think we now have actual tools that we can begin to, to study this and to figure out why it is that the frog genome doesn't just point to frog morphologies, but actually it knows how to make many different things that it pulls down And so what I think are, is that the Platonic space doesn't just contain things that mathematicians like, such as facts about prime numbers and such, but also things that we would recognize as kinds of minds, in other words, behavioral patterns and capabilities And what we make when we make, when, when we perceive, produce embryos, xenobots, computers, pretty much anything You're not really making these kinds of things What you're doing is making pointers that allow the ingression of specific patterns from that space into the physical world And our job is to understand the relationship between the pointers and the thing they bring down And okay, I'm going to stop because I already run way out of time",

  "content_summary": "The speaker hypothesizes that the genome, such as that of a frog, is not limited to creating specific morphologies but can produce a variety of forms. This is linked to the concept of Platonic space, which is believed to contain not only mathematical facts but also behavioral patterns and capabilities. The creation of things like embryos, xenobots, and computers is seen as making pointers that allow specific patterns from the Platonic space to manifest in the physical world.",
