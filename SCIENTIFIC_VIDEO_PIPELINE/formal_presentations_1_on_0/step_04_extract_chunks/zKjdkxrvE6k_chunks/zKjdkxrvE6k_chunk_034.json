  "text": "So it, it has influence in the physical world. But, but, but it isn't something that you're going to find, you know, by, by, by, by studying physics. And so we've started, we've, we've started to ask, you know, what other kinds of patterns might be interesting for biology. And so I'll show you just a couple of quick things. This little thing, when you're looking at it, you might think that this is some sort of primitive organism that we found from a pond somewhere. If you were to sequence the genome, you would find out that you're very mistaken. The genome is Homo sapiens, 100% Homo sapiens, normal Homo sapiens. We call these anthrobots. They're self constructing little biobots that, that are made from adult human tracheal epithelial cells. They are not embryonic. There's no embryonic tissue here. They don't resemble any stage of normal human development. They are what your cells do when liberated from the rest of your body and given a chance to have a new life. The patient that donated these may or may not be alive, but these guys have rebooted their multicellularity. They do some cool stuff. They have novel behaviors which we can arrange in ethograms, like we do for animals. Half their genome is expressed differently than what they were doing when they were part of the tissue inside the patient. They have cool properties like they will heal your neural wounds.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of biobots, specifically 'anthrobots', which are self-constructing entities made from adult human tracheal epithelial cells. These cells, when separated from the human body, exhibit unique behaviors and express half their genome differently. They also possess the ability to heal neural wounds.",
