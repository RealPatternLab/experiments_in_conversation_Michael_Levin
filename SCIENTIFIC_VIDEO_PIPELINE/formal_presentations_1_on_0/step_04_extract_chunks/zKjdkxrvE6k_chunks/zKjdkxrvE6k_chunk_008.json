  "text": "So you'd have no idea that these flat green things were actually capable of building something like this or something like this And there are lots of examples that I could show you how life hacks each itself and each other, and how we are learning to do it One of the most interesting interfaces to this collective intelligence, much like in the brain So what is it in the brain It's bioelectricity or AKA electrophysiology, But that's actually extremely ancient It was used as a cognitive glue by evolution long before brains and muscles appeared And so we now have ways to manipulate, to observe it and manipulate it And just to show you a couple of things, because the visuals are cool, this is an early frog embryo putting its face together And you can see that the colors are voltage, the colors are the different voltages of the cells",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of bioelectricity or electrophysiology, which is an ancient mechanism used by evolution as a cognitive glue before the appearance of brains and muscles. They also mention the ability to observe and manipulate this bioelectricity, using the example of a frog embryo developing its face, where different colors represent different cellular voltages.",
