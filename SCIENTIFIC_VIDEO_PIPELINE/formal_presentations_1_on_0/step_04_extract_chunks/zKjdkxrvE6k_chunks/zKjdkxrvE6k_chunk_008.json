  "text": "So you'd have no idea that these flat green things were actually capable of building something like this or something like this. And there are lots of examples that I could show you how life hacks each itself and each other, and how we are learning to do it. One of the most interesting interfaces to this collective intelligence, much like in the brain. So what is it in the brain? It's bioelectricity or AKA electrophysiology, But that's actually extremely ancient. It was used as a cognitive glue by evolution long before brains and muscles appeared. And so we now have ways to manipulate, to observe it and manipulate it. And just to show you a couple of things, because the visuals are cool, this is an early frog embryo putting its face together. And you can see that the colors are voltage, the colors are the different voltages of the cells.",
