  "text": "And what I thought I would take you through is some ideas that at the beginning of the talk, some things I feel pretty strongly about, and then some things at the end which are kind of way, way at the edge of what we know, and basically speculation that I think is useful nevertheless. Okay, so here are four things I'm going to try to talk about very quickly. First of all, I'm going to address this issue of biology, solving problems at all levels, in all kinds of problem spaces, and argue that genomes are not drivers, if anything, they are more like libraries of affordances, and that evolution makes problem solving agents, not solutions to specific problems. I will not have time to talk about this. Normally, if I give a long talk, I actually show how we go about communicating with the agential material that underlies life, because this is where we have most of our data. Then what I will talk about is give some thoughts about basically the fact that the architecture of life is fundamentally creative because it is dealing with an unreliable substrate, and that this gives rise to a really powerful intelligence ratchet. And towards the end, if we have time, I'll talk about some recent ideas about shifting the perspective of agents versus data and how the notion of Platonic space can be actually useful for research.",
