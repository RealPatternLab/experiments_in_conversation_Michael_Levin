  "text": "But now comes the creative process So this is all of past history, this is your genetics Now comes the fun part of, as if, if you're an embryo or a regenerating organ or anything like that, is to say, what do these things mean And in my current environment and given what's going on now, how do I use this information to do something useful And we have lots of examples in biology of this happening I'll show you a couple more now So basically the idea is that you can't over train on what the past was You assume that the hardware is unreliable, meaning you know you're going to get mutated You know that proteins come and go You have no idea exactly how many of anything is in your cell All of that stuff is Very fluid And for this reason, you have to commit to interpreting on the fly And what evolution does is produce systems that are very good at creative interpretation of data",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the dynamic nature of biological systems, emphasizing the importance of genetics and evolution in the development and regeneration of organs. The speaker also highlights the inherent unpredictability and fluidity of biological systems, including mutations and protein dynamics, and the necessity for systems to interpret and adapt to these changes.",
