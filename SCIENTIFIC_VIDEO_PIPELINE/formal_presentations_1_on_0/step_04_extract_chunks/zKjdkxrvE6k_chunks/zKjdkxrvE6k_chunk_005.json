  "text": "And all of the cells are committed to this one story of what it is that they're building. And the fact that they're all committed to the same story and reliably make that journey together is what allows us to call it one embryo. But if you were to, and I used to do this in grad school with duck embryos, you take a little needle and you put some scratches into this blastoderm. Each one of these little islands will align within itself because it can't feel the others and self organize into a new embryo. And you get multiples, twins, triplets, quadruplets and so on, which may or may not then heal up and reattach.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of cellular commitment in embryonic development, where all cells are committed to the development of a single embryo. However, experimental manipulation, such as scratching the blastoderm, can cause cells to self-organize into multiple embryos, leading to twins, triplets, etc.",
