  "text": "But just to point out that natural living things are a tiny corner of the pot possible space of beings because any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of a system that's going to pull down interesting patterns from the space that we are very bad at predicting. Okay, we cannot, we really, we do not know what, when these things come, they come in extremely minimal forms. It doesn't take much. You know, we found crazy capabilities in classical sorting algorithms, things like bubble sort, which have been studied, you know, for decades. We can talk about that. And I think, you know, basically what Magritte was trying to tell us here when he said, this is not a pipe, is that when. When people say, I know what it is, I've built it, I. I put. I built it with my own hands. I. I chose the material.",
