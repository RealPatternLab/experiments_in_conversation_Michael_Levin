  "text": "But in the meantime, you have multiple individuals. So the question is, how many selves are present in an embryo is not at all obvious. It's not nailed down by the genetics. It's a self organizing process that leads to the creation of anywhere from, I shouldn't say creation, the manifestation of anywhere from zero to half a dozen or more individuals. And the capacity of this excitable medium is not really clear, much like it's not really clear in the brain at all how many actual individuals fit into a particular amount of real estate in the brain. And we can, we can talk about that.",
