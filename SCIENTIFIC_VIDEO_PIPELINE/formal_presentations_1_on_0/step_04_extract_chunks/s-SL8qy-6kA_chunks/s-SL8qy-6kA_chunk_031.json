  "text": "But what they did was they realized there's not enough of them to make a good eye. So they recruited all these other natural cells to work with them to make this eye. Much like ants and termites, a different kind of collective intelligence recruits their friends from the, from the colony to help them move heavy objects. We didn't have to teach the cells to do that. They already do it. As soon as these cells learn that they must make it out, they take on the next step of instructing all these other cells that you have to help. And here's how we make an eye. All of these are things that we have to take advantage of. And this is not available from the bottom up level of genes or proteins or anything like that. We have to understand the decision making and the collective competencies of our material. I want to show you another story about limb regeneration. Normally in frogs, if you amputate the limb, unlike salamanders, frogs do not regenerate their legs at this adult stage. What you actually is something quite interesting. We call it injury. Mirroring the cut leg will, will show you a bioelectric signal here at the wound, but so will the uncut leg. Within 30 seconds, the information passes to the leg that was never touched. And that leg lights up at exactly the same location where the wound happened on the opposite side. It is not neurally mediated. You can remove the spinal cord, it still works fine. That information is spread across and we know bioelectrical networks are really good at spreading information.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of cellular collective intelligence in organ formation, using the example of eye development. They also delve into the phenomenon of injury mirroring and bioelectric signal propagation in limb regeneration, emphasizing that this is not neurally mediated but rather a result of bioelectric networks.",
