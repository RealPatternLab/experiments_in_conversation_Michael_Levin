  "text": "I mean there's a lot of different kinds of intelligence in cell groups, but bioelectricity is a very nice interface to that intelligence, much like it is in the nervous system. And we now have the beginning of tools, both computational tools and practical benchtop tools to begin to use that interface to make applications and birth defects, regeneration, cancer and synthetic engineering. And so the way I see biomedicine developing in the future is that you have all these bottom up interventions. And this is where all the attention has been focused and there's some incredible advances here, but actually there is now this whole new frontier of top down interventions. I haven't even talked about our work in training cells and tissue so behavior shaping them. Here's the agential implants that I talked about, the electroceuticals, all of this and all of this is discussed in great detail here in these papers.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the role of bioelectricity as an interface to cellular intelligence, similar to its function in the nervous system. They mention the development of tools for this interface, with applications in birth defects, regeneration, cancer, and synthetic engineering. The speaker also highlights the shift from bottom-up to top-down interventions in biomedicine, mentioning their work in training cells and tissues, and the use of 'agential implants' and 'electroceuticals'.",
