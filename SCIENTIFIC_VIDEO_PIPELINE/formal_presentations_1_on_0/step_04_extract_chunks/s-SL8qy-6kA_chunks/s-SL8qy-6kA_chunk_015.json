  "text": "So now think about what's going on here. This is. I always visualize this as being in a, in a nuclear reactor control room and the thing is melting down. There are all these buttons. What do you do? You, you. This is a completely novel stressor. These planaria have never seen barium before. You have a physiological, a very strong physiological problem and you need to figure out which of your genes you're going to turn on or off to solve this problem. You can't do it randomly because there's no time to look for, to look for, to look through all the astronomical combinations of possible gene expressions through like a thousand, you know, 20,000 dimensional state space or something like that. And of course, if you start randomly changing genes, you're most likely to kill the cells anyway. How do you find in this scenario? What should you do for this novel problem? And we've seen this many, many times, cells have remarkable ability to find solutions to novel problems. And we as workers in medicine should be looking for a translator interface to ask them how they do it.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of cellular response to novel stressors, using the example of planaria exposed to barium. They highlight the complexity of determining which genes to express in response to such a stressor, and the potential for medical applications if we can understand this process.",
