  "text": "Some animals can do this throughout their lifespan. So for example, here's a salamander. This vertebrate can regenerate its eyes, its jaws, its limbs, portions of the heart and the brain, its spinal cord and its ovaries. Just think how amazing it would be for evolution, for regenerative medicine if we understood how this worked. What happens here is that if you deviate here are the cells have reached their target morphology. Here's a perfect limb. If you amputate anywhere along this length, the cells will very quickly start to build and they will build this structure and then they stop when they're finished. That is the most amazing thing about regeneration, is that it stops when it's done, okay? Because if you deviate it from the correct position in anatomical space, it can tell that that's happened and it will Work very hard to get back to its goal.",

  "content_summary": "The transcript discusses the remarkable regenerative abilities of certain animals, like salamanders, which can regenerate various body parts. The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding this process for advancements in regenerative medicine and evolution. The process involves cells recognizing deviations from their target morphology and working to rebuild the structure until it's complete.",
