  "text": "And thank you to all of you for having me here to exchange some, some thoughts with you. If you're interested in following the details of any of this work for the papers, the software, the data sets, everything is here. And then here are some personal takes on what I think it all means. Let's think about our bodies and some of the magic that actually happens every day. If I told you that with the power of my mind alone, I could depolarize, electrically depolarize something like 30% of the cells in the body, you might think that I'm talking about some sort of yoga practice or some very unusual mind body medicine.",
