  "text": "So again, this idea of homeostasis. But now we have to ask some very basic questions. First of all, how does it know what the correct position is? How does it know what a normal frog face looks like? And number two, how does it do the computations that take it from the abnormal position and get it closer? How does it navigate that anatomical morphous space. Okay, what kind of competencies does it have for navigation and how does it work? Well, we took our inspiration from another system where we know what sorts of mechanisms lead from high level goals in some kind of problem space to the actuation of movement in that space. The most familiar, of course, is the nervous system. The hardware in the nervous system looks like this. You have neurons that have ion channels in their membrane. These ion channels produce a voltage gradient which may or may not be propagated through electrical synapse to their neighbors. And the movement of this electrical information through the network is what underlies the thing that I talked about at the beginning of the, of the talk, which is the ability to pursue goals in a problem space, right? To process information, to remember what your goal is, and then to act in order to get closer to that goal.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of homeostasis and how organisms understand and navigate towards their 'correct' or normal state. The speaker draws parallels between this process and the functioning of the nervous system, specifically focusing on the role of neurons, ion channels, and voltage gradients in transmitting electrical information.",
