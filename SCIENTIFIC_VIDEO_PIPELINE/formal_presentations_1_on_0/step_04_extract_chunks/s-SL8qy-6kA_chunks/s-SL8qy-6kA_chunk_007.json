  "text": "But I want to propose the idea that we should be thinking about this differently. This is not a 3D printer. This is not about micromanaging the cells. This is supposed to be a communications device. It's supposed to be a translator to convert your goals as the bioengineer or the worker in regenerative medicine. It's supposed to translate your goals into those of the cellular collective. In order to understand what I mean, let's ask where does the body come from in the first place? Here is a cross section through the human torso. You can see incredibly complicated organs. Everything is in the right place, and so on.",
