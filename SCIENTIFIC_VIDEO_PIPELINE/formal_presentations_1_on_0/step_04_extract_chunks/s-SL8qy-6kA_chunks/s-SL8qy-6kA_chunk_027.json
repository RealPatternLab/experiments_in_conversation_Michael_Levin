  "text": "So this means with pharmacology, this means with mutant channels, it means optogenetics. All the tools of neuroscience we can deploy here now. Now here comes the critical question. Okay, so what can you do with this? When you change these voltage patterns, what actually happens? How do we know that the cells care about this at all? Well, one thing that you can do is you can call up new organs this way. And I'll show you one in particular. But you can make ectopic inner ear structures. So here are some otocysts, you can make ectopic hearts here you can make extra forebrain, here's where the normal forebrain stops.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the use of neuroscience tools such as pharmacology, mutant channels, and optogenetics to manipulate voltage patterns in cells. They explore the effects of these changes, including the ability to induce the formation of new organs and structures like ectopic inner ears, hearts, and forebrains.",
