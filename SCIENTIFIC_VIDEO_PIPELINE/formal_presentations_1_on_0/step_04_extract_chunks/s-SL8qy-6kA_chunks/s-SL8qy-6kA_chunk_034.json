  "text": "So here's again a normal brain. This is a Brain of an embryo with a mutation in a gene called Notch. Notch is a very important neurogenesis gene. With this dominant Notch mutation, look, the forebrain is basically gone. The midbrain and hindbrain are just bubbles. These animals have no behavior. They're profoundly affected. This is a radical birth defect. Now, what we did was we asked this model how could we fix this. The model pointed us to one specific ion channel called HCM. And it suggested that if we turn on HCN2, the sharpness of the pattern that is ruined here, and I'm skipping a lot of information for a lack of time that I could show you what these patterns look like, that basically what's happening here is that the pattern has become blurry or fuzzy. It's just not sharp enough. And the edges, the brain doesn't know where the edges are. And so we used the opening of HCN2 to sharpen that pattern. And when we do that, and you could do that with drugs that open in native HCN2, or you can introduce novel HCN2 RNA. In either case, case, you're back to a normal shaped brain, normal gene expression in the brain, and in fact their IQs come back to normal. We tested their learning rates and they're indistinguishable from controls now.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses an experiment involving a mutation in the Notch gene, which severely affects brain development in embryos. The speaker suggests that activating the HCN2 ion channel can correct the resulting neural pattern defects, leading to normal brain shape, gene expression, and learning rates.",
