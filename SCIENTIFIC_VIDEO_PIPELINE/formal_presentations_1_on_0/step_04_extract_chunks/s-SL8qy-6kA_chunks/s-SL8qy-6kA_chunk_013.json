  "text": "But if you look carefully and if you use the tools of computational neuroscience and behavior science, you can find phenomena that bridge these two worlds. All of the things that we study in physiology and molecular biology, they are really behavior of unconventional intelligences. I want to show you a couple of examples of problem solving. Here is a planarium, this flatworm, and we discovered this a few years ago, that if you put these planaria in a solution of barium, barium chloride blocks all the potassium channels. The first thing that happens is their heads explode. Literally overnight. Their heads explode because these cells cannot continue functioning without the ability of exchanging potassium with the outside medium.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the intersection of computational neuroscience and behavior science in studying physiology and molecular biology. They present an example of planaria research, where the flatworms' heads explode when exposed to a solution of barium chloride due to the blockage of potassium channels, demonstrating the importance of these channels in cell functioning.",
