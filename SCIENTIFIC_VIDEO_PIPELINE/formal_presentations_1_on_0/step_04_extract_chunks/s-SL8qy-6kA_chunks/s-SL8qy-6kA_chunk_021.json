  "text": "So it is the commitment of neuroscience that, that electrophysiology is what underlies the software of the mind. This is, this is a real time zebrafish brain. You can see all the signal in the zebrafish brain. And the idea is that if we knew how to decode this, we would be able to read out the memories, the preferences, the goals, the behavioral repertoire of this animal, that all of its cognitive features are encoded in the electrophysiology of these cells. This is our inspiration for asking, how does a group of cells know what the goal is? And how does it try to get there? Well, it turns out that this idea, the. The use of electrophysiological networks to process information, to link and align information across distance and across time, from the past to the future, was discovered by evolution very early. It did not wait for neurons and muscles and brains to evolve. It actually evolved around the time of bacterial biofilms.",
