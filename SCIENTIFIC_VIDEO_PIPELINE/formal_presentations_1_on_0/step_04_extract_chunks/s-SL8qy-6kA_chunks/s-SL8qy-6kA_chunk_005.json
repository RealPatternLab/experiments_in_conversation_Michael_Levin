  "text": "So let's think about the end game of medicine. What are we really looking for? I think that in the future, someday you will be able to sit in front of a computer and you will be able to Dr. Draw the anatomy of the plant, animal, organ or biobot that you want, whatever it is, you can draw anything you like, any anatomical structure whatsoever. And if we have this anatomical compiler, what it will do is convert that description into a set of stimuli that have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly this, in this case, this nice three headed flatworm.",

These designs would then be converted into cellular stimuli by an 'anatomical compiler', instructing cells to construct the desired structure, such as a biobot or organ.",
