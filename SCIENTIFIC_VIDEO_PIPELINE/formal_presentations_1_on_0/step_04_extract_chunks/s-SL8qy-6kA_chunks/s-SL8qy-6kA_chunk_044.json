  "text": "But the idea is that that bioelectrical system that pervades our bodies is an interface to the intelligence that exists at different levels. And now, especially with AI tool tools, we have the ability to not only communicate as we do now with drugs and surgery and so on at the very lowest level, but we can now communicate with some of these higher levels and take advantage of the idea of complex goal driven outcomes propagated down through the intelligence of the tissue, not simply micromanaged. And. Okay, I'll end here. And I just want to thank the people who did all the work.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the bioelectrical system that pervades our bodies, acting as an interface to various levels of intelligence. They highlight the potential of AI tools to communicate with these higher levels of intelligence, moving beyond traditional methods like drugs and surgery, and leveraging the idea of complex, goal-driven outcomes propagated through the tissue's intelligence.",
