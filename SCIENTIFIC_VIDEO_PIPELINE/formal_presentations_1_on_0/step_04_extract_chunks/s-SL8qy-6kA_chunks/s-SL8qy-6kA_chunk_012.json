  "text": "So let's talk about this. We as humans and as scientists are reasonably good at detecting intelligence in three dimensional space. So we see birds or primates, maybe a whale or an octopus or something, and we see medium sized objects moving through three dimensional space at medium speeds and we can notice intelligence. But I want to stress that in biology there are many other spaces in which intelligences navigate and make decisions and solve problems and feel stress and so on. There is transcriptional space, so the space of all possible gene expression levels, there is physiological state space. And this one we'll talk more about today, which is anatomical morphospace or the space of possible anatomical configurations. In all of these spaces, they are very hard for us to visualize. We don't consider these kinds of actions as behavior.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of intelligence in biology, emphasizing that it is not only observed in physical movements but also in other spaces such as transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical morphospace. These spaces, which involve gene expression levels and possible anatomical configurations, are challenging to visualize and are not typically considered as forms of behavior.",
