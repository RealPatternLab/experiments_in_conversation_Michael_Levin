  "text": "For example, how does it change over time, how does it spread over distance, all that kind of thing. I want to show you two interesting patterns. This is a time lapse of the frog embryo putting its face together. So you can see. And this is a grayscale color map of the voltage. And you can see there's a lot going on. But this is one frame from that video. In this one frame we call this the electric face. And this was first found by Danny Adams in my group. What happens is that long before the genes come on and the cells are starting to build a face, these bioelectric patterns are already regionalizing the tissue. And they are telling the cells where all the organs are going to be.",
