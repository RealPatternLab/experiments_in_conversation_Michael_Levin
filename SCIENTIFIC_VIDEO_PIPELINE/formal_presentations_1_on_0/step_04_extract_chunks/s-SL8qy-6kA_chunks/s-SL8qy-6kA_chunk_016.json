  "text": "In other words, we should be able to ask the cell, for a given stressor, what kinds of homeostatic adjustments would you do? Because actually they can do many things that we have no idea how to do. But let's move beyond this single cell survival and talk about anatomy and where the body comes from. Now we know that development is incredibly reliable. So these eggs reliably will give rise to a normal target morphology. And also we know that there's a huge rise in complexity from this state state. Anatomically complexity rises. But the reason I'm calling this intelligence is not because it becomes more complex or because it is reliable. That's not sufficient for intelligence. What I'm talking about is problem solving. And specifically the idea that if you take these early mammalian embryos, for example, and you cut them into pieces, you don't get half bodies. What you get are perfectly normal monozygotic twins and triplets. And that's because this process can reach the goal state, the goal state in anatomical space being something like a normal human morphology, from different starting positions. They will in fact avoid local minima and get to where they're going through novel paths. And regulative development does an amazing job at this.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of cellular homeostasis and how cells can make adjustments in response to stressors. The focus then shifts to the development of anatomy from a single cell to a complex organism. The speaker emphasizes the reliability and complexity of this process, and introduces the concept of regulative development, which allows for normal development even when embryos are divided into pieces.",
