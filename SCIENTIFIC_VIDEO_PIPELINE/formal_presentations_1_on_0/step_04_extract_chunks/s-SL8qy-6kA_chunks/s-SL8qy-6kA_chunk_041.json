  "text": "This is probably around 10 of these anthrobots. They form this cluster. But what they're doing here, if you look carefully, is they're knitting together the two sides of the neural wound. In other words, when you lift them up four days later, you find that underneath this is what they were doing, they were healing. The gap here between this injury, these Are IPS neurons like peripheral innervation. Who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which sit quietly for decades in your airway, have the ability to form a multi little creature that looks nothing like a standard human or any human developmental sequence. They express thousands of genes differently than the native human tissue, almost like a different life form. And yet they have this amazing capacity to heal your body. And so this is the beginning of what we call agential interventions. You know, drugs are very simple, they're mechanical, they just do what they do.",
