  "text": "Now the ability to learn and to solve problems is baked into the very bottom of the substrate of which we are all made. In fact, the whole body functions as something we call a multi scale competency architecture, where all the way from the bottom. So the molecular networks, the subcellular organelles, the cells, the tissues, the organs and groups and colonies, you see that each level of organization solves problems. It is not just the structurally nested set of dolls, one within the other, but actually it is a set of diverse intelligences which solve problems in different kind of spaces. And I will talk about how that works.",
