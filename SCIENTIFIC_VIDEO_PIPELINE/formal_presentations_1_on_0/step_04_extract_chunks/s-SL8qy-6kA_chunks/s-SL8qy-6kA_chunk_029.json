  "text": "But it turns out that if you use potassium channels, so ion channel MRNA for specific potassium channels and you inject them into regions of the embryo where they will set up that little spot, that little voltage pattern that I showed you in the electric face. If you set up that pattern somewhere else, then what it does is convinces cells to build an eye. So here's an eye made out of cells that were going to be gut here. And if you section that eye, you have lens, retina, optic nerve, all the same, same kinds of things that that should be in an eye.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the role of potassium channels in embryo development and bioelectricity. It highlights an experiment where specific potassium channels were injected into an embryo, which led to the formation of an eye from cells that were originally going to form the gut. This indicates the potential of cellular reprogramming and differentiation.",
