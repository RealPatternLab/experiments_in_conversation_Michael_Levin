  "text": "This is online at this, at this link. Anybody can look at different tissues, both normal and transformed, and it will tell you which are the ion channels that are your potential targets. And that makes it easy for you to pick Electroceuticals. Now we can pick drugs. Something like 20% of all, all drugs are ion channel drugs. And so there's this enormous toolkit that allows us to do these kinds of things. Once the computational model tells you what to do, the final thing I want to show you has to do with cancer. Our cells are extremely good at solving little tiny problems. They have very small goals. Their goals are around metabolic state, about the ph level. These little tiny goals really at the level of a single single cell.",
