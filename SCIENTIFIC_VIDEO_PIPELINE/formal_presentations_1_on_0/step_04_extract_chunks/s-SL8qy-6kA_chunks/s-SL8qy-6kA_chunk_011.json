  "text": "Now, when I say intelligence and problem solving, I mean this. William James gave this definition of intelligence. It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means. So I'm not talking about human level intelligence. I'm not talking about what it feels like to solve problems or consciousness or anything like that. I'm talking about a very objective third person kind of competency to navigate some kind of problem space and reach your goal when new things are happening. And this requires, of course, fundamentally this is problem solving and it requires a lot of plasticity. It means that you can't just do the same thing every time. You can't rely on your genome to instruct you on exactly what to do you have to have problem solving capacity?",
