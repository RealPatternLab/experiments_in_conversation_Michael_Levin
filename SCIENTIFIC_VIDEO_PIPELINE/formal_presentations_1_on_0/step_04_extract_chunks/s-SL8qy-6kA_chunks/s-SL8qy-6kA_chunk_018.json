  "text": "So this is a kind of homeostasis, this is a kind of anatomical homeostasis. Now this regeneration is not just for the so called lower animals. So the human liver, of course, is highly regenerative. Deer regenerate huge amounts of bone and vasculature and innervation. Every year they grow about a centimeter and a half of bone per day. When they're doing this, it's just remarkable. Human children have also, below a age, have also been known to regenerate their fingertips. So we have some regenerative capacity, obviously not as good as a salamander. But the most interesting part of this is the ability to accommodate novel scenarios.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of anatomical homeostasis and regeneration, providing examples from various species, including humans. They highlight the remarkable regenerative capacities of certain animals, like deer and salamanders, and compare them to the lesser, but still present, regenerative abilities in humans, such as liver and fingertip regeneration in children.",
