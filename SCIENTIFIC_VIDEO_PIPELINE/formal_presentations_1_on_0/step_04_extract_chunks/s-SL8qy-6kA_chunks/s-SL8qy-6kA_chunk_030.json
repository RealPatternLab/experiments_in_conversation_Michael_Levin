  "text": "But notice, notice a couple of interesting things. First of all, the bioelectric Pattern is clearly instructive by re. By rearranging that pattern somewhere else, you can call up whole entire organ. So it's clearly functionally determinative of what happens. It's not an epiphenomenon. The second thing is that it is incredibly modular, meaning that we didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye. We didn't say anything about stem cells, about gene expression, about the geometry of all the different tissues inside the eye. We didn't say any of that. All we provided was a very high level subroutine call that says build an eye here. And this is really great for regenerative medicine because that means we can call up complex downstream outcomes without having to or knowing how to micromanage the details. And then finally, just to point out another interesting competency of the material, look, this is a cross section through an eye in the flank of an embryosome somewhere. The blue cells are the ones that we actually targeted with our ion channel rna.",
