  "text": "We've now started moving from the frog model into the human model. This is some recent work, Juanita Matthews recent work in human glioblastoma and looking for ion channel drug combinations that actually normalize these cells and make them stop proliferating and be more neural. Like. The very last thing I want to show you is this. Take a look at this little creature. If I asked you what this was, you might guess that, that it's some kind of simple life form that we found on the bottom of a lake somewhere. And also, if you thought about its competencies, you might think that the conventional kinds of things that simple aquatic animals make.",
