  "text": "But what we is that, and other people have found this as well, is that even within single cells, the molecular networks, so gene regulatory networks, protein pathways, things like this already exhibit many different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning. And you can find that in the details in these papers. But in these molecular networks, if you stimulate various nodes by providing agonists to turn on specific elements in this pathway and you trace what happens to certain output nodes, you will find that you, you can see dynamics of habituation, sensitization, associative conditioning, and probably much more. We're looking for many other things.",
