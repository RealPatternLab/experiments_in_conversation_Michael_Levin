  "text": "But then if you hold onto these tails, something interesting happen. Over a couple of weeks time, these heads will regenerate, a new head. And the new head in barium, you keep them in barium, the new head will form and the new head is completely barium adapted. So it has no problem being in this barium solution. So we asked the simple question, how is that possible? We looked at the genes expressed in these barium adapted heads compared to the genes in the normal head. And we found that really there's only about a dozen or so transcripts that are, that are different.",
