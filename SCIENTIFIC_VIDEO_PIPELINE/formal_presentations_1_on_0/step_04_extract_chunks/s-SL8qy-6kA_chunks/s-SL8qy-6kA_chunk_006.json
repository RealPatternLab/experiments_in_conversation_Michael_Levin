  "text": "Now why we need something like this is clear. If we had the ability to convey our goals to groups of cells, then all of this would be solved. There would be no more birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. All of this would be solved if we had the ability to tell cells what to build. Now why don't we have this? Molecular biology and biochemistry have been advancing wonderfully over the decades. Why don't we have anything remotely like this? I think that's because we've been thinking about this problem in the wrong way. Many people when they see this, they think, well, this is some 3D printer control gene expression, something to put the cells where they need to go to form whatever structure you want.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the potential of bioelectricity and cellular communication in solving major health issues like birth defects, traumatic injuries, cancer, aging, and degenerative diseases. The speaker suggests that the ability to 'tell cells what to build' could revolutionize medicine, but acknowledges that current understanding in molecular biology and biochemistry is insufficient to achieve this.",
