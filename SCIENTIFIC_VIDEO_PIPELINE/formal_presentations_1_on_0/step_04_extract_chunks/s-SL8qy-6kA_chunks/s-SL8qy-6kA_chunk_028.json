  "text": "So you can make this extra large forebrain, we can call up extra limbs. So here's our six legged FR frog here and so on. And one particular example I want to show you in, in a little bit of detail is the induction of ectopic eyes. So this is the, the developmental biology textbook will tell you that only the cells here in the anterior neurectoderm are capable of forming eyes. And that's because they use this so called master eye gene called PAX6 to try to induce eyes. And it's true, if you use PAX6 it only forms up here.",
