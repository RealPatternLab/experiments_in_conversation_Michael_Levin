  "text": "But at the same time, we are exposing it to conditions and an environment where I would guess, you know, especially after learning about your work, like, the cells are in some way trying to do this problem solving on their own. And so I'm wondering, like, from. In terms of us trying to advance the function of the tissues, do you have any thoughts about, like, the way we should be approaching treating these cellular collectives? Should we just go off? Should we try to copy in vivo environments or, you know, explore other alternatives? Anyway, yeah. So the two approaches to this that I've written about and also that we are trying to follow in our lab are first of all, training.",
