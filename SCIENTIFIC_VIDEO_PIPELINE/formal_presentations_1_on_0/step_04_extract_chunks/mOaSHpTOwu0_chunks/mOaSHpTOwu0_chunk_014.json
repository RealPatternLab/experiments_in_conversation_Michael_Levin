  "text": "But it turns out that they absolutely do change their behavior when you provide these kind of sound stimuli. So, you know, these little tight circles. As soon as you turn on the sound, they do this. And then eventually they go. When you stop, they go back to this. Not exactly the same. So maybe there's a little bit of residual memory, but we're trying to figure that out. So all of these things, we're now doing behavioral experiments to ask, what do they remember? What can they learn? What are their preferences? And the last thing that I'll just show you is that this is not some weird fluke of frog development. This little thing, which looks like we got it off the bottom of a pond somewhere, is actually, if you were to sequence it, It's Homo sapiens, 100% wild type Homo sapiens. These are anthrobots made of human tracheal epithelial Cells. And they also do some interesting things. If you played a bunch of human neurons and you put a big scratch through it, they will traverse that scratch, but then they'll pick a spot and sit down and they sort of form the superbot cluster. And what you see is that what they're actually doing is healing the gap. They can actually induce repair. If you lift them up four days later, this is what it looks like. They can actually induce repair across this gap.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses experiments on bioelectric organisms, anthrobots, and their responses to sound stimuli. The organisms, including human tracheal epithelial cells, exhibit learning and memory behaviors, and have the ability to repair and heal gaps, suggesting a form of cellular memory and learning.",
