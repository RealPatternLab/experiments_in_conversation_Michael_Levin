  "text": "But actually at those meetings there have been very few bioengineers. And so the opportunity for a cross fertilization of this, of these field and roboticists, the opportunity are massive, I think. Other questions? Thanks so much, Michael, as always. Good to see you. Curious about the sound, how you chose that. Is it just like a really nice, precise, non invasive way to do mechano transection, or was there another reason that sort of motivated that choice? Okay, so the question of sound to begin with was simply because we did the transcriptomics and we found this cluster of hearing genes and we thought, okay, maybe this thing is trying to, maybe this is the bigger picture here, I think, is the idea that these novel systems with a novel lifestyle are problem solving in the sense that they. And I have other examples we could talk about that dip into their genome to start to transcribe things that are going to be useful in this lifestyle. Right. And so this, this sort of primed us when we saw the hearing, is that, okay, let's, let's just test it now in terms of what the sound, what the sound is. The only thing we've published so far is one single wavelength is a sine wave and that's it, right? One, one frequency and it's a sine wave. We are currently testing everything from a full frequency sweep to we play different kinds of music that we Let them talk to each other, because, you know, there's a million things. And so the jury's very much still open on what they're doing with that information. While I'm sure the molecular view of this thing is some sort of mechanotransaction, that's probably how they're hearing.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the lack of bioengineers in his field and the potential for cross-fertilization with roboticists. He also delves into his research on the use of sound in biological systems, specifically the discovery of a cluster of hearing genes and the ongoing exploration of their function and potential applications.",
