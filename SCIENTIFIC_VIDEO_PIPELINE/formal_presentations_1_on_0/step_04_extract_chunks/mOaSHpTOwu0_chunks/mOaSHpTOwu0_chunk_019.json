  "text": "So I want to hear your insight about this. Yeah, my current framework for all of this stuff is that I think the most powerful advances in predicting their behavior, in manipulating their behavior and so on, are not going to come from thermodynamics or from quantum biology, although I'm sure those things have important Things to tell us. I think the biggest impact on this is going to come from behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, because I think that those things, those disciplines are not about neurons at all. They're about much more fundamental aspects of different modalities that function as a cognitive glue that basically scale the competencies of subunits and project them into novel problem spaces. And there is a wealth of information there that have so far approaches both experimental and conceptual, that have so far been deployed around brains and development.",
