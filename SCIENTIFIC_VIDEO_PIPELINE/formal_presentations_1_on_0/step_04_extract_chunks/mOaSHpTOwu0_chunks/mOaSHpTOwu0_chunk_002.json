  "text": "This is the sort of thing we're dealing with now. This is a pre living organism called Alacrimeria. But you get the idea It's a single cell. There's no brain, there's no nervous system. It's handling all of its needs in anatomical space and metabolic space and physiological space. From that one cell normally develop all of these kinds of amazing creatures, including these that will actually have very significant problem solving cognitive capacities. What we know from developmental biology is that this is a slow and grad. There is no specific magic line at which intelligence kicks in. This is a process of scaling competencies, not a process of magical categories. And so we need to understand the scaling in order to have good interactions with the material. In fact, it turns out that even below the single cell level, so just the molecular networks themselves, let's say gene regulatory networks or molecular pathways, already have six different kinds of learning that they can do. This does not require a cell or synapses or any of that, just the molecular pathways themselves. And this is a free gift from the mathematics of networks. They can already do habituation, association, pavlovian conditioning. And we're now taking advantage of all of that for experiments in drug conditioning for biomedical purposes. And so the material has these capacities sort of all the way from the very bottom. And what I think is happening here is a kind of multi scale competency architecture where each level, and so here are all the levels of organization. Each level is basically deforming the option space for the levels below, but each level is navigating that space. Context sensitive navigation of the option space. And these are transcriptional spaces, physiological state spaces, anatomical morphous space.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the complex cognitive capacities of single-celled organisms, the role of molecular networks in learning, and the concept of multi-scale competency architecture. It emphasizes the idea that intelligence and learning are not confined to organisms with brains or nervous systems, but can be observed at the molecular level, and even within gene regulatory networks.",
