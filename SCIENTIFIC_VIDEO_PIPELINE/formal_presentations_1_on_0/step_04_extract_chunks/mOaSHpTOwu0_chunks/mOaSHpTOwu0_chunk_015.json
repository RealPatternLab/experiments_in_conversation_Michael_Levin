  "text": "So who would have known that your tracheal epithelial cells have the ability to form this autonomous little biobot, run around and heal wounds? They have thousands, about 9,000 genes differently expressed than the tissue of origin. Tons of amazing things here that we're still mining. Four discrete behaviors that you could build a behavioral ethogram of. And we're also working on trying to understand what their protocognitive properties look like. And so the very last thing that I'll just say, and this is, you know, kind of the weirdest, the weirdest part of this is that we have to start thinking, if it wasn't a history of selection, which, which people take to, to, to explain this, this path, this kind of thing, you know, what, what are these xenobots turning into? If it, if it wasn't direct engineering, which we didn't do, all we did was liberate the cells. We didn't program them in any way. And if it wasn't selection, where does other information come from? And I just want to pitch this, this, this idea that, you know, we do have a precedent for information that does not come from the physical world.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the surprising abilities of tracheal epithelial cells to form autonomous biobots capable of wound healing, exhibiting unique behaviors, and potentially possessing protocognitive properties. The speaker also raises questions about the origin of information guiding these cells, suggesting it may not come from physical or selection-based sources.",
