  "text": "But what we did understand is that they have this amazing interface that if we understand the currency of, of the way that they learn. So rewards and punishments and behavior shaping paradigms and all this kind of stuff, then you can get some amazing outcomes, Even if you're not micromanaging the synaptic chemistry. I have a feeling that that's what we're going to need to do here is to get a much better idea of what do the cells actually want to do, what do they value as rewards and negative reinforcement, and how can we do behavior shaping to get them to do it.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the potential of understanding and influencing cellular behavior through bioelectricity, without micromanaging synaptic chemistry. The focus is on understanding what cells 'want' and 'value', and how behavior shaping paradigms can be used to achieve desired outcomes.",
