  "text": "So, so, so we have these experiments where we hit them with something that's never been around during evolution. Within, you know, within a week, they find. They find the solution. And so how do they find it? Because this, I think, has massive biomedical implications. So I think all of this has the two layers. There's the biophysical layer where it's like. Yeah, it's mechanotransduction, no doubt. But the bigger question is what information is processing, how and why. Hi, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts. You know, we're in this field, especially with the muscle tissue. We're, in a sense, we're trying to replicate the form and function of an organ that exists in a, you know, as a part of an organism. Yep.",
