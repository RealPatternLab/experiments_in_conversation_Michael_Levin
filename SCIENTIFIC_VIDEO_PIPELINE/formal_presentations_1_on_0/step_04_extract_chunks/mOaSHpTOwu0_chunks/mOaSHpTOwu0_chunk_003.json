  "text": "And these are transcriptional spaces, physiological state spaces, anatomical morphous space. And then at some point when nerve and muscle kicked in, then of course, three dimensional space of behavior. But all of this kind of relationship, relationship is present all the way down. And what each level is doing is deforming the option space for its parts to ensure that their conventional behavior is also serving the needs of a higher level in a different space that the parts don't know anything about. This enables some very interesting properties in the biological material. First, just as an example, and we could do hours and hours on these examples, there are many, many cool versions of this. Here's a tadpole of the frog. And so you'll see nostrils, mouth, brain, here, gut. What you'll notice is that we've prevented the primary eyes from forming, but we've put an eye on its tail. What we noticed by building a machine that automates the training and testing of these guys in visual cues is that they can see perfectly well. Here's the ectopic eye. It makes one optic nerve.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses various spaces in biology including transcriptional, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral. It highlights how each level influences the option space of its parts to serve the needs of a higher level. An experiment on a tadpole, where an eye was placed on its tail, demonstrates these concepts.",
