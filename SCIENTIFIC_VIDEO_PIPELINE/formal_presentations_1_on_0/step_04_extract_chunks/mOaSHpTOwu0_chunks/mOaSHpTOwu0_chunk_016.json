  "text": "In other words, this is a, this is a mathematical object called a heli plot of this little function. And if you want to ask why does it have the particular shape that it has? The answer is not anything about its evolutionary history. It's not anything about any facts of physics. It comes from other laws of mathematics that many Platonist mathematicians are studying as a structured, ordered set of patterns. This map of mathematics. I just want to argue, and again, this would take hours to do this properly. But just to point out that I think we need to go a lot far beyond emergence as an answer to the question of where do these properties come from? And we need to ask what are the structured patterns that we are releasing here? And I view these synthetic beings as vehicles for exploring this latent space. And I think this is the research program. And so as we make cyborgs and hybrots and biobots and all these kinds of things, yeah, they're Combinations of evolved material, engineered material, sometimes software, but also patterns from the space of mathematical patterns that are not to be found specifically among the laws of physics. And I think just by itself, emergence is not going to do the trick. We really need to develop tools to understand, to map out that space and map out the interactions between the physical interfaces that we make and the patterns that we see. And so this, now the ability to use all of these amazing features of the living material is part of the field of diverse intelligence where and we are trying to use some AI tools to communicate across all the different levels.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the importance of mathematical patterns in understanding the properties and behaviors of synthetic beings, such as cyborgs, hybrots, and biobots. He suggests that emergence theory alone is insufficient to explain these phenomena and emphasizes the need for tools to map out the interactions between physical interfaces and observed patterns. He also mentions the use of AI tools in the field of diverse intelligence.",
