  "text": "So our postdocs, some, some, some amazing postdocs and grad students that did the work that I showed you today, lots of collaborators that work with us, always thank the funders and of course most of all to the model systems, both biological and synthetic, in every combination that has taught us all of these things. So I'll stop here. Thank you. Any questions from the audience? Yes, hello, It's Ines Barringham, B2 student from Sheffield. So I want to ask you about your insights. If we using Kaufman principles, like dealing with the biological cells as reaching steady states in a non liquid environment, or use it our dealing models the biological cells in quantum undeterministic rules. This will help us to predict what its behavior and making it. We predict it so we can know what it will do, so we can control it by controlling its behavior, without controlling it really.",
