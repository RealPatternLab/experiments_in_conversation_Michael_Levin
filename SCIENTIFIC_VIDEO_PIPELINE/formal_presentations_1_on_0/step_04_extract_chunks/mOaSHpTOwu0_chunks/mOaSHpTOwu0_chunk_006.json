  "text": "But biology has been navigating all these other spaces and in particular doing the sensing, decision making, actuation loop in all kinds of other spaces, high dimensional, weird spaces that are hard for us to visualize, like transcriptional space, anatomical morph space, which is what we study, physiological state space, and so on. So embodiment is really not just about motility in three dimensional space. When we build these things that navigate space spaces in ways that we would like them to do, we have to think beyond just motion in three dimensional space. All of these other spaces, and probably many that we can't even visualize, are fair game for this.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the complexity of biological systems, emphasizing that they operate in more than just three-dimensional space. He highlights the importance of understanding these 'spaces' such as transcriptional, anatomical morph, and physiological state spaces, in order to effectively manipulate biological systems.",
