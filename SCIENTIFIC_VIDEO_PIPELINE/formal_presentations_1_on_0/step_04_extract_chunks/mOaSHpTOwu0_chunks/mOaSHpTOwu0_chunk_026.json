  "text": "In other words, you can ask the cells what they want to do by giving them control over the environment. In other words, you set up a closed loop system where different actions lead to different outcomes. And in effect, you get to ask the cells, you let them find the kinds of behaviors that give them the stimuli and the outcomes that are meaningful to them. And I think by doing that, we learn more about the system and then we can become much better at motivating them. And I always think back to. Humans have been training dogs and horses thousands of years before we knew any neuroscience, and we had no idea about mechanisms.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the concept of asking cells what they want to do by giving them control over their environment, setting up a closed loop system where different actions lead to different outcomes. He draws an analogy to humans training animals, suggesting that understanding these cellular behaviors can help us become better at motivating them.",
