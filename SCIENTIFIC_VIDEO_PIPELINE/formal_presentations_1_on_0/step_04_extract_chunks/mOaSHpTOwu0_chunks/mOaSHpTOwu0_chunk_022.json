  "text": "While I'm sure the molecular view of this thing is some sort of mechanotransaction, that's probably how they're hearing. I mean, they're using, you know, they're using cilia the same way that we do and so on. So I'm sure at the, at the lowest level, that is probably exactly what they're doing. But at a higher level, what I want to understand is ecologically, why are they. Why. Why is this now important? Why are they to trying transcribing these genes? And on the computation side, I want to know how it is. What is the internal causal architecture that allows that system to go from this is my environment to now this is what I want to transcribe. How is it? And the other examples that we've had in our lab have to do with, for example, flatworms identifying just a half dozen genes out of a. Out of a genome of tens of thousands, when it's. When that. That will allow it to overcome a novel toxin that it's never seen before.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction, specifically through cilia, and the ecological implications of gene transcription. They also express interest in understanding the computational aspects of how organisms adapt to their environment by selectively transcribing genes, using the example of a flatworm overcoming a novel toxin.",
