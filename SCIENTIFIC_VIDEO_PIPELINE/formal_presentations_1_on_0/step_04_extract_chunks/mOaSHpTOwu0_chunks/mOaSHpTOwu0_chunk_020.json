  "text": "But all of this stuff works in many other contexts. So not just the learning and molecular networks, but use of hallucinogens, of anesthetics, of serotonergic modulators to literally change the priors, the decision making, the certainty, all these kinds of things that you normally think of when dealing with animals. All this stuff works, as far as I can tell, all the way down. And so to me, all of this, that is where the biggest advances are going to go is from the field of diverse intelligence applied to bioengineering. And there's a massive opportunity there because actually that field is very focused on natural animals of all kinds. They think about bacteria and unicellular organisms and whales and things.",
