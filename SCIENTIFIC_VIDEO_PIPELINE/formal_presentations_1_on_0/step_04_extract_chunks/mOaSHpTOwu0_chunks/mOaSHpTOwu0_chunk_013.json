  "text": "So all of these kinds of things are completely spontaneous. We're not pacing it or controlling it. Now, one of the studies that we've made of it is what are the transcriptional, what does the transcriptome look like of a creature that has a novel lifestyle that has not been selected for? It turns out that it has hundreds of genes that are expressed very differently than these same cells back in the embryo. I'll just show you one example of what it does as it dips into the genome to pick out novel things that are there for this lifestyle. There's a whole cluster of genes that actually is associated with sensory perception of sound. And we thought that's kind of amazing. Is it possible that these things could actually hear or respond to sound? And so what we did was this experiment. We put a speaker under this. And again, this is just brand new kinds of things.",
