But rewards and punishments and training of cells and tissues for specific outcomes. So building closed loop, this is one thing we're doing now, not with muscle, but for other reasons, is build a closed loop device that continuously rewards for desirable behavior and exploiting the learning capacity to basically train, not physically force, but to train the cells to do what you want them to do. That's the first thing. The second thing, which you can do with that same kind of platform is instrumental learning.",
