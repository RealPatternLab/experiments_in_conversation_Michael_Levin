First of all, it allowed us to understand that things that we think of as quite different are actually the same thing. They are different expressions of the same underlying dynamics. So an incredibly powerful unification. And then it allowed us to build technologies and to realize that while we are directly only sensitive here, that's just a contingent fact of our evolutionary history. In fact, with tools, with the right equipment, we are now we can become sensitive to all of this stuff. And of course there are many applications. And so, and so this is what I'm really interested, I'm really interested in creating tools, conceptual tools, but and also practical bench tools.

And slowly but surely there's this gradual process, this amazing magical process of embryonic development that takes the system from being the domain of physics and chemistry to being the domain of psychology and psychoanalysis, or at the very least, behavioral science. Okay? So we know from developmental biology that there is no special magical point where these things kick in and you become a mind, as opposed to previously being just physics. And so this is what we need to understand. We need to understand the scaling of this of mind as it goes from these kinds of very simple things to something much more complex. By the way, there are some other paths along this journey, so I won't have time to talk about it today, but if anybody wants to ask me, we can discuss what happens later in terms of a dissociative identity disorder of your body, which is basically cancer. And there are some other even weirder things that can happen, which I will describe in a moment where your cells can have an entirely new life even after the death of the original human donor as anthrobots. And we'll talk about that. And the key to this is that the key to understanding this process is that very differently from how we build our computers and robots. And we can talk about as well, if somebody wants to ask what the differences actually are. There are some really interesting differences. We are made of an agential material.

If you're interested in things like causal information theory and Tononi's models of, of phi and integrated information that some people think is associated with consciousness, those already exist here at the molecular network level. Inside of that cell, the material, the tiniest material, already has aspects of learning and integrated information.
