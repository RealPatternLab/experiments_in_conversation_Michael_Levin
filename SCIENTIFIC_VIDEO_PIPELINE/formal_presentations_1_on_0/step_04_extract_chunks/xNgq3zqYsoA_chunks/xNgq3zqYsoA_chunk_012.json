  "text": "In other words, alignment towards a specific journey in anatomical space. An anatomical space being just the space of all possible configurations that a body might take. And that all of these cells agree. They all share the same. They've bought into the same model of where they're going to go in anatomical space. And then they make this one embryo. That's what you're counting. You're counting commitment to a model. And if you make little. Little scratches in this. In this blastoderm, then each one of these islands is going to do the same because it's unaware of the presence of the others. Eventually it might heal up or it might not, but basically, then you get twins and triplets and so on. And so what you see here is the question of how many individuals are inside this excitable medium is not known in advance. It's not set by the genetics. It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more. And there are potentially multiple different cognitive beings that come out of this because of this process of differentiation. Where do I End and the outside world begins. That's what's happening here. And that of course, has lots of parallels to issues of individuation and dissociation in the cognitive sphere.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses how cells align towards a specific journey in anatomical space during development, forming an embryo. The speaker also highlights that the number of individuals formed is not predetermined by genetics, and that differentiation can lead to multiple cognitive beings. The process draws parallels to issues of individuation and dissociation in the cognitive sphere.",
