  "text": "So here's Here's how we We all enter the world We start life as a little blob of chemistry and physics It's a little unfertilized oocyte The Then there's this incredibly magical process called embryogenesis, where slowly and gradually there's never a magic lightning flash that takes you from physics to the land of psychology But what happens is eventually you become one of these beings that are susceptible to the tools of behavioral science or maybe even psychoanalysis and something like this And so the story of our origin is really the story of scale scaling up, of cognition and transformation It's really, as scientists and philosophers, we need to understand this transformative process of how mind emerges from these simpler components In fact, if you look at an early embryonic blastoderm, there might be a couple of hundred thousand cells at some particular stage And you look at that and you say, well, there's an embryo When you say it's an embryo, what are you counting What is there one of There's hundreds of thousands or millions of cells What is there one of Well, it turns out that the best thing you could say is that what there is one of is commitment to a particular story",
