  "text": "So here's the. The limb of a, of a salamander. If you amputate that limb anywhere here, the cells will rapidly build, and then they stop when it's done. So so their goal, the goal of the collective, is to build this thing. And you know, it's a goal because if you deviate them from that goal, they will work really hard, they will achieve it, and then they will stop. So now no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, but the collective absolutely does. As you can see here, it's very reliable.",
