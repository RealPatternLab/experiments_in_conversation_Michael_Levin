  "text": "So that means ion channels and electrical synapses known as gap junction, just like in neuroscience So this is the communication interface that we hack If you do this, you can do some interesting things First of all, you can shift the border of the self, of an agent So just to explain what I mean, this single cell that I've shown you before has very tiny goals All of its goals are in terms of space, time, kind of radius The cognitive light cone is very small, both in space and time But when they get together, these cells can pursue really grandiose goals",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the role of ion channels and electrical synapses in cellular communication, likening it to neuroscience. They mention the ability to manipulate these processes to alter cellular goals and identities. The concept of a 'cognitive light cone' is introduced, representing the scope of a cell's goals in terms of space and time.",
