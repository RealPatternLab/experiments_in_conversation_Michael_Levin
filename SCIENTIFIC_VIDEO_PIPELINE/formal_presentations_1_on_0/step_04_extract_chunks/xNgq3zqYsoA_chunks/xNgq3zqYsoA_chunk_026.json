  "text": "But the idea is much like what, when I'm talking to you now, I don't need to worry about reaching into your brain and changing all the synaptic structures in your, in your brain to make sure you remember what I've told you. You do that on your own. I'm only providing a very kind of thin stimulus. And you do all the hard work of managing the underlying biochemistry in your brain to form memories, make decisions, and so on. Same thing here. We are not telling the cells what to do. We are not talking to the genesis genes or the Stem cells, we provide a very high level signal, build an eye. That's it. The system being, being a good multi scale cognitive system, it then takes that and does all of the underlying biochemistry that's needed to implement the message that, that we've given them.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of bioelectricity and cellular communication, drawing parallels between how the brain forms memories and how cells interpret signals. The speaker emphasizes that cells, like the brain, can interpret high-level signals and manage the underlying biochemistry to achieve complex tasks, such as building an eye.",
