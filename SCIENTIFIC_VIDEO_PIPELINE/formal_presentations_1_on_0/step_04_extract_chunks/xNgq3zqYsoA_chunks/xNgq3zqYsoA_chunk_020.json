  "text": "So that means ion channels and electrical synapses known as gap junction, just like in neuroscience. So this is the communication interface that we hack. If you do this, you can do some interesting things. First of all, you can shift the border of the self, of an agent. So just to explain what I mean, this single cell that I've shown you before has very tiny goals. All of its goals are in terms of space, time, kind of radius. The cognitive light cone is very small, both in space and time. But when they get together, these cells can pursue really grandiose goals.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the role of ion channels and electrical synapses, or gap junctions, in cellular communication. They explain how manipulating these elements can shift the 'self-border' of a cell, altering its goals and capabilities. When cells cooperate, they can pursue larger goals, expanding their 'cognitive light cone' in space and time.",
