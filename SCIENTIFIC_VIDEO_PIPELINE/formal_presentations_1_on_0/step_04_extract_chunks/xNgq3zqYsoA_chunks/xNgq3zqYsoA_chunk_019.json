  "text": "So what we've developed are tools that let us see the electrical signals moving between all of the components of this collective intelligence. So this is just like neuroscientists do in the brain, except we can now do this anywhere in the body. So the colors indicate voltage levels. Here's a bunch of cells in the dish. This is an early frog embryo. And now what we can do is we can read the mind of the body by reading these electrical signals. We can try to interpret them and then try to understand what is it that what are the memories, the preferences, the goals and so on of this new collective intelligence? We now have a way to also write information. We don't use electric fields or waves or frequencies or anything like that. We manipulate the interface that the cells are normally using to control each other.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the development of tools that allow for the visualization and interpretation of electrical signals between cells, akin to neuroscience studies in the brain. He highlights the ability to 'read' and 'write' information to cells, manipulating their normal interfaces for control, using a frog embryo as an example.",
