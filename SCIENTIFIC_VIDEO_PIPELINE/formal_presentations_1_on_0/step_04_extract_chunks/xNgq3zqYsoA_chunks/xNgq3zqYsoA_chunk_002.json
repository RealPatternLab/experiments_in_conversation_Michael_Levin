  "text": "So I'm not going to do a lot of on that in the main talk. But if you want to ask me questions about it later, it's the kind of the most common thing that comes up. So I'd rather talk about some of the more unusual things. One thing that I want to be very clear on with respect to evaluating risk in science is that we really have to think about the opportunity cost. In other words, lots of people approach risk in scientific discovery with a kind of an unspoken assumption that everything is great now and you scientists better not screw it up.",
