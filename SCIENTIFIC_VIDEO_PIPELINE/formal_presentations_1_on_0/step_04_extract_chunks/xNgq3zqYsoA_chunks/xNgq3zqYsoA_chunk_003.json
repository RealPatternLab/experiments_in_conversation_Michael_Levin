  "text": "In other words, don't do anything that makes the situation worse. That's a lot of, a lot of these discussions come from that, from that place. But actually, you probably know, things are absolutely not great. There is incredible biomedical suffering out there. I'm not a clinician, I'm not an md, but I get emails, probably a dozen emails per day from people in the most unbelievable extremes of pain and infirmity and disease and whatever. And so it's really hard for young, healthy people to realize what we're actually talking about here. And so I think, yeah, we absolutely have to think about the risks, but we also have to think about the ethical imperative to do something to help the situation. And I actually think it is a kind of moral cowardice to sort of leave it alone and say, not my problem. I'm just going to sit back and try not to make things worse. I think that's not the right way to go. And also, of course, there's issues with the environment and so on. Past the biomedical kinds of things. I'm going to talk about this notion of freedom of embodiment, because after we learn to fix all of the issues of the body towards the normal standard complement of form and function, then you realize that you can use the exact same tools to actually create any kind of embodiment that you want. And so this is something, of course, that we can think about in any discussion of ethics. And, and then towards the end, I'm going to talk about just, just the bigger picture of how that leads to a huge variety of unconventional beings with which we are going to share our world and already share",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, emphasizes the critical need to address biomedical suffering, arguing for an ethical imperative to intervene rather than avoid making things worse. He introduces the concept of 'freedom of embodiment', suggesting that once we can correct bodily issues, the same tools could potentially be used to create any desired form of embodiment, leading to a variety of unconventional beings.",
