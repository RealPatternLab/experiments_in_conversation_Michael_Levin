  "text": "So I'm going to make the claim that we as humans, we have a significant amount of mind blindness. We're reasonably good at recognizing things like this. And so lots of people study birds and primates and maybe a whale or an octopus or things like this, but there are all kinds of other creatures. And one of the things that I try to do in my group is to develop a framework and that allows us to think about diverse intelligences, so all kinds of weird colonial organisms and engineered new life forms that have never existed before. I'm going to show you some today. Artificial intelligence, whether purely software or robotic, maybe someday aliens. And even really exotic things that don't look like beings at all, such as patterns, actually active patterns with the media. And so that spectrum, instead of the electromagnetic spectrum, what we have here is a spectrum of agency, okay? And we could talk about this for the longest time, but fundamentally what we have is some kind of a gradual continuum where passive matter, if there even is such a thing, slowly scales up its cognitive capacities to eventually become something like a metacognitive human or whatever is beyond that. And so this is what we work on, if you're interested. This paper has a lot of the details, and I think this is not just a philosophical task because as we have shown, if you do this well, it leads to new biomedical and bioengineering advances.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the concept of mind blindness and the need to understand diverse intelligences, including those of artificial intelligence and engineered life forms. He introduces the idea of a 'spectrum of agency', a continuum where passive matter gradually scales up its cognitive capacities to become something like a metacognitive human. He suggests that this research could lead to advances in biomedical and bioengineering fields.",
