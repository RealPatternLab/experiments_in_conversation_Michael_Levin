  "text": "And, and then towards the end, I'm going to talk about just, just the bigger picture of how that leads to a huge variety of unconventional beings with which we are going to share our world and already share our world and what we owe to these, to these beings. That, that. And so, and so that kind of brings us, brings us back full circle, right? You can see this is kind of really a cycle, even though I've, I've, I've listed it linearly. So, so the first, the first thing we need to think about is, well, what are all the beings that are relevant to ethics? And so we, when we see something like this, so here's a kind of Oscar winning performance here. This little squirrel knows exactly what's going on. She's going to put the thing on the neck. Ah, look, it's had a terrible accident. It's even going to look to see if the humans are watching to make sure that, see, are you guys looking? Look, I've had a terrible accident. And so when we see something like this, it's very obvious that this is something that has intelligence, that this is something that has preferences, that it has a theory of Mind. And so that we, you know, that we have to be. We have to be kind to things like this. And it's obvious to us because it functions on the same scale of space and time, it operates in the same space as we do in three dimensional space. It has somewhat similar goals to us in terms of survival and physiological integrity and so on.",
