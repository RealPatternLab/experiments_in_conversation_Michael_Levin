  "text": "All right, thank you so much. This is really fun. I've not given a talk specifically on this topic, but I take it very seriously and I think about it all the time. So let's try it and see how it goes. If you want to follow up on any of the science here, this is my official lab webpage that has all the papers, the data sets, the software, all that stuff. And then this is my personal blog with some kind of somewhat crazier version of what I think all of these things mean and so on. So what I'd like to do today is first just give you a quick outline of what I'm going to do, the kind of the journey I'm going to take you on. I'm going to try in the next 25 minutes to take you through a few different things. And fundamental to ethics is I think, this question of what should I do next? And I think fundamental to that is the question of what am I really? And how do I relate to the outside world? And this is a lot of what we do, even though we have a wet lab, a large wet lab where we do all kinds of work on cancer and bioengineering and so on.",
