  "text": "In other words, alignment towards a specific journey in anatomical space An anatomical space being just the space of all possible configurations that a body might take And that all of these cells agree They all share the same They've bought into the same model of where they're going to go in anatomical space And then they make this one embryo That's what you're counting You're counting commitment to a model And if you make little Little scratches in this In this blastoderm, then each one of these islands is going to do the same because it's unaware of the presence of the others Eventually it might heal up or it might not, but basically, then you get twins and triplets and so on And so what you see here is the question of how many individuals are inside this excitable medium is not known in advance It's not set by the genetics It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more And there are potentially multiple different cognitive beings that come out of this because of this process of differentiation Where do I End and the outside world begins That's what's happening here And that of course, has lots of parallels to issues of individuation and dissociation in the cognitive sphere",

  "content_summary": "The transcript discusses the concept of cellular differentiation and commitment in embryonic development, where cells align towards a specific journey in anatomical space. It also explores the idea that the number of individuals within an excitable medium is not predetermined by genetics, leading to the possibility of multiple beings due to differentiation.",
