  "text": "So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of that will disappear once we know how to tell cells exactly what to build. It's a communication problem. It's not 3D printing, it's not gene editing. It's a translator. What you need is a translator interface from our goal to that of the agential material of life. But you realize now that this means that you don't just have to stick to the standard human shape. If somebody decides that, you know what, I'd like to have a couple of extra arms and maybe an eye on the back of the head and maybe it should be infrared sensitive and whatever, all of that should be completely possible.",
