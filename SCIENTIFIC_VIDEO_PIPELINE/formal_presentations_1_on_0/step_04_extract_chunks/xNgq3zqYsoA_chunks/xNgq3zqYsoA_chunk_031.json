  "text": "So human patients donate tracheal epithelial cells. And we have a way of enabling them to self assemble. We really don't do much. The cells do all the, all the hard work. They self assemble into this little motile creature. This creature has four different behaviors that it switches between. So you can build a little ethogram of its behaviors. If you look at the gene expression here, this volcano plot, they express about 9,000 genes differently than the cells in the body that they come from. In other words, about half the genome is drastically remodeled. But, but we haven't touched the DNA. We haven't done anything to the genome. We haven't added any weird nanomaterials. There are no synthetic biology circuits. These are completely wild type cells and yet they're capable of having a very different embodiment. This looks nothing like any stage of human development. And they pick and choose what genes out of the, out of the genome they're going to express. They have some wacky capabilities. Like if you played a bunch of human neurons here, these anthrobots will come and they'll sit down in this superbot cluster and they start repairing the gap.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the self-assembly of donated human tracheal epithelial cells into a motile creature with distinct behaviors. Despite no alterations to the DNA or genome, these cells express around 9,000 genes differently from their original state, indicating a significant genome remodeling. These self-assembled structures, referred to as 'anthrobots', also demonstrate the ability to repair neurons.",
