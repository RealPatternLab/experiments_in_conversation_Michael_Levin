  "text": "So I'm going to make the claim that we as humans, we have a significant amount of mind blindness We're reasonably good at recognizing things like this And so lots of people study birds and primates and maybe a whale or an octopus or things like this, but there are all kinds of other creatures And one of the things that I try to do in my group is to develop a framework and that allows us to think about diverse intelligences, so all kinds of weird colonial organisms and engineered new life forms that have never existed before I'm going to show you some today Artificial intelligence, whether purely software or robotic, maybe someday aliens And even really exotic things that don't look like beings at all, such as patterns, actually active patterns with the media And so that spectrum, instead of the electromagnetic spectrum, what we have here is a spectrum of agency, okay And we could talk about this for the longest time, but fundamentally what we have is some kind of a gradual continuum where passive matter, if there even is such a thing, slowly scales up its cognitive capacities to eventually become something like a metacognitive human or whatever is beyond that And so this is what we work on, if you're interested This paper has a lot of the details, and I think this is not just a philosophical task because as we have shown, if you do this well, it leads to new biomedical and bioengineering advances",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the concept of mind blindness in humans and the importance of recognizing diverse intelligences in a variety of organisms and artificial constructs. He presents a spectrum of agency, illustrating a continuum from passive matter to highly cognitive beings, suggesting that understanding this spectrum can lead to advances in biomedical and bioengineering fields.",
