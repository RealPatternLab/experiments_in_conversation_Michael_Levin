  "text": "So it actually drives new science and I think really, really critical. It's actually going to lead to better ethics. So another way to think about this is that if, you know the history of numbers, first we had some counting numbers, and then somebody invented zero, and then we had some negative numbers, and then we had the rationals, and then somebody realized that that wasn't enough and, you know, we needed the irrationals and so on. And each of these, each of these expansions of what we understand as number broke prior concepts as far as what defines the set of numbers. It required a conceptual leap to get there and to expand our understanding. And it was actually quite stressful for everybody. I mean, people, people died over this, you know, discovery that the rational numbers weren't all there is, you know, a lot of it.",
