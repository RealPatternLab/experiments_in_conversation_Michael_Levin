  "text": "But the other thing is the plasticity, the incredible plasticity of life There's never been any anthrobots, there's never been any evolutionary selection to be a good anthrobot Where does this come from We can talk about that too But what that means, that incredible plasticity means that almost any level in biology can be augmented or manipulated by engineering And so when we talk about ethics, a lot of people like to compare, well, I'm a real human, and then there are these machines and we're very different Well, the problem you're all going to be facing in your lifetime, no doubt about it, is not what to do with language models sitting inside a server somewhere It's this, this guy has had various modifications and there are a lot of people who are going to be interested in figuring out is this a quote unquote real human Is it You know, what are we going to do Is it 51% implants and now you're not a real human What is going to happen to beings that are, that are extended, rationally extended and modified in other ways And that opens up numerous questions and really I think is going to be very difficult and lead to a lot of moral lapses if we insist on binary categories where using old school methods, we're going to try to figure out if this is a human or a machine I'm going to skip a couple things here because we're running out of time just to end on this",
