  "text": "So much like we augment ourselves now with toothbrushes and antibiotics and education and glasses and crutches and working out and clothes and all of this kind of stuff that we use now to go beyond our kind of quote unquote natural state in the future you're going to be able to do that even more so biologically. And I think the beings of the future, and I don't think it's a very far future, I think it's not that far off, are going to look back and think it is completely unimaginable that people in our day had to live their whole life in the body. They were handed at birth. You know, you were, you're, you're born. The details of your body, of your limitations, physical and mental limitations are currently set by stray cosmic rays that, that hit the cells of embryos. You know, Going back however many, however many eons ago, and, and people, I, I think people of the future are going to be aghast at this, at this notion that we just had to, we just had to live that way. And there was no, no, you know, no, no, no opportunity for, for improvement, you know, deal with the consequences of these, of these stochastic processes that don't really care about our goals or our capabilities or our values or any of that.",
