  "text": "So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of that will disappear once we know how to tell cells exactly what to build It's a communication problem It's not 3D printing, it's not gene editing It's a translator What you need is a translator interface from our goal to that of the agential material of life But you realize now that this means that you don't just have to stick to the standard human shape If somebody decides that, you know what, I'd like to have a couple of extra arms and maybe an eye on the back of the head and maybe it should be infrared sensitive and whatever, all of that should be completely possible",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the potential of cellular communication in addressing various health issues such as birth defects, cancer, and aging. He suggests the possibility of a 'translator interface' that could instruct cells to build specific structures, potentially allowing for bioengineering beyond the standard human form.",
