  "text": "So the scale of the goals, right, the border between self and world has grown huge. The self is gigantic here, the self is very tiny here. But that process can break down. So here's human glioblastoma cells. These are cancer cells that are basically disconnected electrically from the collective. And at that point, they're back to their unicellular lifestyle. They just can't remember the large scale goal of building a nice, nice brain or anything else. And so once you understand that, you can actually control that electrical connection between cells and force a larger cognitive light cone onto the system.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of bioelectricity and its role in cellular communication, particularly in the context of cancer cells. They highlight how glioblastoma cells, a type of cancer cell, disconnect electrically from the collective, reverting to a unicellular lifestyle and losing their 'memory' of their role in larger biological structures.",
