  "text": "But I think fundamentally this is the sort of thing that we actually work on. So I'm going to talk to you about this idea that we are all a kind of collective intelligence. In fact, I'm going to try to show you and again hard in 25 minutes, but I'll at least show you a few examples why I think really the world consists of intelligence all the way down, okay? Not just brainy mammals and birds and things like that, but all the way down. The implications of that, amazingly enough, are that we can reach all kinds of interesting new biomedicine if we understand how intelligence is implemented in our bodies. And so that gives all kinds of opportunities. There are always in the discussion of ethics, I'm sure somebody will be interested in the risks.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the concept of collective intelligence, suggesting that intelligence is not limited to traditionally 'brainy' organisms but is a universal trait. He proposes that understanding how this intelligence is implemented in our bodies could open up new avenues in biomedicine, though ethical considerations and potential risks must also be addressed.",
