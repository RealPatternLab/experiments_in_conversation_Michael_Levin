  "text": "So what you have here are a bunch of cells that are using different affordances, different genetically specified affordances, meaning different mechanisms that they have to get the job done in the face of incredibly weird circumstances If you're a newt coming into this world, you can't count on the outer environment Of course things will change, but you can't even count on your own parts You don't even know how many copies of your genetic material you're going to have You don't know what the size of your cells are going to be You don't know what the number of your cells are going to be You have to get, you have to reach that region of anatomical amorphous space with new, various new tricks using the tools you have Despite all of the all these novelties that is a standard version of intelligence, that is how they measure IQ tests, is they'll say, you've got these parts now creatively use them to solve this problem you've never seen before Okay, this is a system that does that, but not in 3D space It does it in anatomical space And it means the fact that the living material has this kind of beginner's mind aspect to it where it does not assume, in fact, at least most organisms do not assume that everything is going to go the way that it used to go For its ancestors, they have this ability to creatively use their genome and its products to solve problems That means that not only can they do things like this, they can also do things like this Here's a tadpole, here's the mouth, the nostrils, the brain, the spinal cord here What we've done is prevent the primary eyes from forming",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses how cells adapt to unpredictable circumstances using genetically specified affordances, or mechanisms. This includes adjusting to variations in genetic material, cell size, and number. The speaker also compares this to a form of intelligence, as cells creatively use their genome to solve problems in anatomical space.",
