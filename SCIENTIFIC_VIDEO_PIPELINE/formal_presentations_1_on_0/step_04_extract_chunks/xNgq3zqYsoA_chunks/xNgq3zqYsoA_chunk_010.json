  "text": "But we know that, that we stand at the center of this continuum both on an evolutionary and developmental timescale where we started life as a single cell and whatever was the origin before that. And so this too is a set of slow changes. And whatever you think whatever philosophical properties this, this, this human has, you have to have some story of what happened in the previous stages, like how did we get here? And what. And you know, is it, is it gradual? Is it, is it discrete? You know, what's going on? And as I'm going to point out in a minute, this is not enough. There's another spectrum that we are at the center of which is the set of biological and technological changes that again, slowly and gradually could move us beyond what. What this is. And then again, you have to ask yourself, you know, where. Where does this agential glow peter out? And then you don't have to worry about these things anymore, or does it ever. And things like that.",
