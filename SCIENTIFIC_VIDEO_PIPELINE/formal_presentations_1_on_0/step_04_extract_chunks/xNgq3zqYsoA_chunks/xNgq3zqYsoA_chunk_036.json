  "text": "But basically, basically patterns that are not in the physical world at all is, is some kind of being with some kind of embodied intelligence that we are going to have to learn to live with. And part of the ethics of the future is developing a kind of synth biosis, a synthetic mutually beneficial interaction with beings that are not like us at all. So I'm just going to thank the postdocs and the students who did some of the work that I showed you today. And again, some disclosures. There's three companies that have spun out of all this stuff and our funders and most of all the systems that we learn from. They do all the heavy lifting.",
