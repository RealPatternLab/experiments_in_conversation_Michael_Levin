  "text": "In other words, you have to obey physics, but within the context of that, in your life you do all kinds of things that are not actually prescribed by the physics at all And it doesn't take life and it doesn't take complexity and it doesn't take a brain to be able to do that I think it's baked in all the way down And that means that all of natural life is a tiny little speck in this enormous space of possible bodies and minds You know, pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material, software, and something I haven't had a chance to talk about",
