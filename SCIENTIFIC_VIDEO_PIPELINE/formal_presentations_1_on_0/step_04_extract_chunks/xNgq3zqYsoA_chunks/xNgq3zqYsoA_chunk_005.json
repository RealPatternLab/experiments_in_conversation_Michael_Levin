  "text": "So this is easy, but actually it gets much more complicated because, and I'll just use an example of the electromagnetic spectrum. Back in the day, there were phenomena such as lightning and static electricity and magnets and light and all kinds of things. And until we had a proper theory of electromagnetism, we had no idea that all of these were actually the same thing. Okay, we thought they were disparate phenomena. And, and what a proper theory of electricity and electromagnetism did for us is that it allowed us to say, first of all, that actually all of these things are manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon. That phenomenon is continuous.",
