  "text": "So here's a human oncogene injected into this tadpole. It will make a tumor. The tumor has this really weird electrical state where you can see the cells are actually disconnecting from their neighbors. But if you prevent them from doing that, even though that oncoprotein is blazingly expressed, it's the same animal. So there's tons of that nasty oncogene. There's no tumor, because what you've done is kept the cells connected to the neighbors, so they're part of this mind meld of building nice skin, nice muscle, and so on. So the cancer cells aren't more selfish. They have smaller selves. The border between self and world has shrunk and we've reinflated again.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the role of oncogenes in tumor formation, highlighting the unusual bioelectric state of tumor cells. They emphasize that preventing cellular disconnection, even in the presence of oncogenes, can inhibit tumor formation, suggesting that the 'selfishness' of cancer cells is related to their reduced connectivity.",
