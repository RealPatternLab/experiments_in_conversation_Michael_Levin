  "text": "So once, once you, once you see all this, you realize that, that, that what we eventually are going to have is something that I call the anatomical compiler. In other words, once you understand how to tell groups of cells what, what to build, then, then you get to move from, from just from repair to freedom of embodiment. Because then you are going to be able to sit down and draw any kind of a plant, animal, organ, biobot, whatever. And the system should be able to compile it into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly whatever you want it to build. And so yes, it will, it will. If we had that, which, which we don't yet, but, but eventually we will. And if we have that, all of this would go away.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of an 'anatomical compiler', a theoretical tool that could instruct groups of cells to construct any desired biological structure, from organs to biobots. This would represent a significant advancement in bioelectricity and developmental biology, moving beyond repair to the freedom of embodiment.",
