  "text": "You sort of make perturbations and you notice they can get to the same goal by different means. So that's William James's definition of intelligence. Okay, so we've detected them. What's the next step? Well, how do we communicate with them? If we're going to have a relationship with, with these intelligences, how do we communicate them with them? Well, we discovered that a very important kind of communication with them can take place through the bioelectric interface, just like you and I are now communicating through the bioelectrical interface of your nervous system, of your retina and your auditory stream and your nervous system. Turns out this is also a very good way to communicate with the cellular intelligence of your body.",
