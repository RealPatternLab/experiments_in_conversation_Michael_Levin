  "text": "So they'll sit there and they'll knit the neurons together across this wound. Now, who would have Thought, who knew that the cells in your airway are capable of becoming a self motile little creature that by the way, likes to heal neural wounds. We would have never known that. So the biomedical aspect. So there's two aspects of note here. The biomedical aspect is that someday you will have biobots made of your own cells that can be injected into your body to make repairs. You don't need immune therapy because they're your own cells. They won't be rejected. And can we learn to program these things to enhance their healing abilities so that they can, they can have all kinds of useful, useful activities in the body.",

They further explore the concept of 'biobots', made from a person's own cells, which could be used in the future for internal body repairs without the need for immune therapy.",
