  "text": "So the final thing I want to show you in the last couple of minutes is this. If you look at this little creature. So now let's go even beyond. So I've shown you how to communicate with the intelligence of the body for repair. Then the idea that you can use that to make radical changes in the structure. You can make other kinds of, different kinds of embodiments. And now I want to go even further than that and really talk about the plasticity and the capabilities of the material of life. What else can it really do? So if you look at something like this, this looks like some kind of primitive creature I got off the bottom of a pond somewhere. It actually, it turns out if you were to sequence the genome, it's 100% Homo sapiens. We call these anthrobots. These are made of adult human cells.",
