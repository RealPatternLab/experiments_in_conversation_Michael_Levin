  "text": "But it operates in many spaces It operates in the space of gene expression, it operates in the space of physiological states, and it operates in anatomical morphospace, which is again the space of shape configurations And this is the one we'll talk about today And when I say life operates in these spaces, I mean that it navigates those spaces adaptively to solve problems, just like conventional animals that you're used to navigate a three dimensional space to solve problems I'll give you just one, one simple example of how What I mean by that, by that, this is a cross section through a kidney tubule in a newt And you can see it's got a lumen in the middle And then you got these 8 to 10 cells that work together If you make new embryos with multiple copies of their genome, the cells will get bigger to accommodate the additional Genetic material Oddly, the newt stays the same size And you say, well, how could that be And that's because while the cells are bigger, what they do is they adjust And fewer of them are now making the exact same structure Until you make a newt with so many copies of their genome that the cells become gigantic And instead of many cells working together to build this, one single cell will bend around itself and leave a hole in the middle Okay, this is the different mechanism, These are different molecular mechanisms",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses how life operates in various spaces such as gene expression, physiological states, and anatomical morphospace. The concept is illustrated with an example of a newt's kidney tubule, where cells adjust their size in response to genome multiplication, maintaining the same overall structure.",
