  "text": "But it operates in many spaces. It operates in the space of gene expression, it operates in the space of physiological states, and it operates in anatomical morphospace, which is again the space of shape configurations. And this is the one we'll talk about today. And when I say life operates in these spaces, I mean that it navigates those spaces adaptively to solve problems, just like conventional animals that you're used to navigate a three dimensional space to solve problems. I'll give you just one, one simple example of how. What I mean by that, by that, this is a cross section through a kidney tubule in a newt. And you can see it's got a lumen in the middle. And then you got these 8 to 10 cells that work together. If you make new embryos with multiple copies of their genome, the cells will get bigger to accommodate the additional Genetic material. Oddly, the newt stays the same size. And you say, well, how could that be? And that's because while the cells are bigger, what they do is they adjust. And fewer of them are now making the exact same structure. Until you make a newt with so many copies of their genome that the cells become gigantic. And instead of many cells working together to build this, one single cell will bend around itself and leave a hole in the middle. Okay, this is the different mechanism, These are different molecular mechanisms.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses how life operates in various spaces such as gene expression, physiological states, and anatomical morphospace, using the example of a newt's kidney tubule. The speaker explains how cells adjust their size to accommodate additional genetic material without changing the overall size of the newt, and how different molecular mechanisms come into play when the cells become too large.",
