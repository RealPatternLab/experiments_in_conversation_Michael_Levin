  "text": "In other words, it's a spectrum. It's not a set of discrete things. Even though we like to cut it up into regions just for convenience, it's actually a spectrum. And most importantly, that we are natively, because of our evolutionary history, we are only sensitive to a tiny part of that spectrum. All of this stuff, we had no idea that all of this stuff existed until that theory enabled technology that now, with the technological appliances and the theory behind them, enable us to recognize and make use of all kinds of other phenomena in our universe to which we were completely blind.",
