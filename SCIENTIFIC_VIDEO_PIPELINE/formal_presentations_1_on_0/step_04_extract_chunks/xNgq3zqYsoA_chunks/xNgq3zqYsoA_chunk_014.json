  "text": "So spirit split brain patients whose left and right hemispheres don't communicate very well Dissociative identity disorders where you have multiple personalities on the same brain hardware and so on So you're already starting to see that it's not at all as simple Our origin and the underlying mechanisms are not what is commonly portrayed in philosophical discussions of humans and our ethical duties and so on This is the sort of thing we're made from Now This happens to be a free living one called the Lacrymaria But this is a single cell It has no brain, no nervous system, very competent in all of its local goals",
