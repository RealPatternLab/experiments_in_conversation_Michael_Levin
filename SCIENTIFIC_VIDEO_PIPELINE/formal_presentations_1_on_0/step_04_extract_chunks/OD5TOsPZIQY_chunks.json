What there's one of is a story that all of the cells have bought into a self model that guides their movement in anatomical space, in the space of possible anatomical configurations. And the reason there's one embryo is because all the cells agree that is where they're going. If you were to, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a graduate student. If you take a little needle and you put some scratches in this plastoderm. Each one of these islands doesn't feel a presence of the others, and so they align among themselves. They decide they're the embryo, but they all do it. And this is how you get twins and triplets and things like this. That means that the number of individuals inside an embryonic medium is not determined. It's certainly not set by genetics. It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more in a standard blastoderm. And so how many actual individuals or cells can emerge from that medium is not obvious.

This is a very simple function in complex number z, so z cubed plus 7. For example, if you do something called a Hali plot, where it's a very simple algorithm for plotting the roots of this and how the roots behave of this function, you get this amazing complex pattern. Doesn't hurt that it's kind of very organic looking, which is why I use this example. But what's salient here is that there's a tiny seed. It encodes a very complex, very rich kind of structure. And if you wanted to explain why it looks like this, there are no facts of the physical world that explain it. There is nothing in the history of, of the physics of the universe that explains why this is the way it is. The explanation does not come from the physical world. You cannot tweak any of the, you know, the, the constants of, of the universe at the beginning of the Big Bang. And get a different pattern out of this. It, it is an extra thing that is, is distinct from information you get from your genetic lineage and information you get from your physical environment. Environment.

This ability to have the freedom to express patterns from that space that are not fully determined by the physics of your world or the algorithms that, that we think you are following, it is always richer than that, even in extremely simple systems. And so just, just to remind us again, you know, Magritte was telling us that, that our formal models are not the thing itself. And I would say the same thing. You know, there's a lot of organic thinkers who are down on computationalism, and they say living things aren't, aren't machines. They say, right, nothing is machine because a machine is a formal model that humans have defined to, to handle certain aspects of what physical objects do in the world. And it doesn't fully describe even the simplest kinds of systems, never mind, of course, the biological systems.",

And I think for exactly the same reason that the rules of biochemistry don't encompass the story of the human mind. Formal models of algorithms and materials do not encompass the story of minimal beings. So really, I think we have to get much wider in our perception of what we can relate with. So I'll just, I'm going to end here and just thank the people who did the work that I showed you. Here's some postdocs and students and collaborators in our lab and disclosures are three companies that have spun off from the work that we do. And of course, thank our funders and the model systems because they've done the most hard work in teaching us about this stuff.",
