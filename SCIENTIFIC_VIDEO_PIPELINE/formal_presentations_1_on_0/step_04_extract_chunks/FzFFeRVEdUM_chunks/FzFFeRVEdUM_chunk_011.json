  "text": "So when you look at this kind of dissociation, there are many things that we learned here about split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders and so on. And what's actually happening in this process that's really interesting is the scaling of goals. So I coined this thing called a cognitive light cone, which is basically meant to be the boundary of the self. It's meant to be the thing that distinguishes a self from the outside world. And what it is is the scale of the largest goal you can pursue. So again, not the range of your senses, not the reach of your effectors, but the size of the largest goal state you can remember and you can pursue. In single cells, they have tiny little goals, they have short memories, short anticipatory power in the future. And their goals are things like this, like ph. They're scalars, they're single numbers about things like ph within the cell.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of dissociation, particularly in split brain patients and those with dissociative identity disorders. A concept called 'cognitive light cone' is introduced, which represents the boundary of self and is defined by the scale of the largest goal one can pursue. This concept is then related to single cells, which have smaller, scalar goals and shorter memories.",
