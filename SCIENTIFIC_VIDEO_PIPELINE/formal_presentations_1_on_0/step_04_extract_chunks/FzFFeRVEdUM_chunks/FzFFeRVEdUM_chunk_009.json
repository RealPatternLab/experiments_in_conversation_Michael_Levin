  "text": "Okay, what keeps these things aligned is a self model that they all accept. And I said under normal circumstances, because what you can do, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a grad student, you can make little scratches in this blastoderm and every one of these little islands that's formed until it heals up, it doesn't know about the existence of the others. And so they form their own embryo. And then eventually you get twins and triplets and whatever. So the number of individuals in this embryo is not set by the genetics. It is not obvious, it is not determined up front. They can self organize by all aligning towards different aspects of that story, and they will all complete the journey on their own.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of self-organization in embryogenesis, using the example of manipulating duck embryos. He explains that the number of individuals in an embryo is not solely determined by genetics, but can also be influenced by bioelectric signals that guide cellular alignment and differentiation.",
