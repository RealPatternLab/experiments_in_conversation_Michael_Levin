  "text": "Okay, what keeps these things aligned is a self model that they all accept And I said under normal circumstances, because what you can do, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a grad student, you can make little scratches in this blastoderm and every one of these little islands that's formed until it heals up, it doesn't know about the existence of the others And so they form their own embryo And then eventually you get twins and triplets and whatever So the number of individuals in this embryo is not set by the genetics It is not obvious, it is not determined up front They can self organize by all aligning towards different aspects of that story, and they will all complete the journey on their own",

They emphasize that the number of individuals is not genetically predetermined, but can be influenced by external factors.",
