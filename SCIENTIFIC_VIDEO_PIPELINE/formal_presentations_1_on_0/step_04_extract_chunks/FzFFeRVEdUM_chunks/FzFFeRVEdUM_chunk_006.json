  "text": "So it's a little bag of chemicals that obey physical laws. And slowly but surely there's this gradual process, this amazing magical process of embryonic development that takes the system from being the domain of physics and chemistry to being the domain of psychology and psychoanalysis, or at the very least, behavioral science. Okay? So we know from developmental biology that there is no special magical point where these things kick in and you become a mind, as opposed to previously being just physics. And so this is what we need to understand. We need to understand the scaling of this of mind as it goes from these kinds of very simple things to something much more complex. By the way, there are some other paths along this journey, so I won't have time to talk about it today, but if anybody wants to ask me, we can discuss what happens later in terms of a dissociative identity disorder of your body, which is basically cancer. And there are some other even weirder things that can happen, which I will describe in a moment where your cells can have an entirely new life even after the death of the original human donor as anthrobots. And we'll talk about that. And the key to this is that the key to understanding this process is that very differently from how we build our computers and robots. And we can talk about as well, if somebody wants to ask what the differences actually are. There are some really interesting differences. We are made of an agential material. The reason that robots and computers, at least for now, don't get cancer is because they are made of passive parts. And then hopefully the whole system has some degree of intelligence.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the transition from physical and chemical processes to psychological and behavioral processes during embryonic development. They also touch on the concept of 'scaling of mind' and the potential for disorders like cancer. The speaker introduces the concept of 'anthrobots' and 'agential material', contrasting biological systems with artificial ones like computers and robots.",
