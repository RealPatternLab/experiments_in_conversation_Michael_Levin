  "text": "But when they got together into networks, that electrical network allows them to store grandiose goals So here's an axolotl These amphibians regenerate most of their body parts, including their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, their spinal cords, and so on And if you were to amputate anywhere along this, the plane of this limb, these cells would immediately sense that they've been taken away from their goal They would work really hard to rebuild And when they get there, they would stop How do they know when to stop They stop when a correct salamander limb has been completed They stop when they get back to their homeostatic state",
