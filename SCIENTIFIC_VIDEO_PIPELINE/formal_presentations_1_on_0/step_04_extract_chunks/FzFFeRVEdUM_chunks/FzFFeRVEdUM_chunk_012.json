  "text": "But when they got together into networks, that electrical network allows them to store grandiose goals. So here's an axolotl. These amphibians regenerate most of their body parts, including their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, their spinal cords, and so on. And if you were to amputate anywhere along this, the plane of this limb, these cells would immediately sense that they've been taken away from their goal. They would work really hard to rebuild. And when they get there, they would stop. How do they know when to stop? They stop when a correct salamander limb has been completed. They stop when they get back to their homeostatic state.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the bioelectricity in organisms, particularly axolotls, and how it contributes to their remarkable ability to regenerate body parts. The speaker explains that cells in these amphibians sense when they've been removed from their 'goal' due to amputation and work to rebuild until they reach their homeostatic state.",
