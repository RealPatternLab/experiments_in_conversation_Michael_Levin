  "text": "Challenge in 20 minutes of transmitting some fairly unconventional concepts. And I will do that. And then I can answer questions about the details of how it all works. Actually, at this website, you can download all of the data sets, the software, the control, everything is here. And then this is my own sort of personal thoughts about what this all means. So I want to start here with this classic piece of art called Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden. And this is a worldview that, even for people who are not overtly religious, this is, I think, really a worldview that permeates modern science. And it's the idea that there are these distinct categorical species. They're all different from each other, they're innumerable. We know what they are. And then Adam over here is different. This, I think we're going to have to blow up. And I'll show you the ways in which we sort of dissolve that.",
