  "text": "So when you do that, you make an eye These eyes have all the right, you know, lens, retina, optic nerve They have all the right things And by the way, they can do another neat trick, which is that if you only inject a few of them So here are the blue ones are the ones we injected They will actually recruit their neighbors to make this lovely lens that's sitting out in the, in the tail of a tadpole somewhere We didn't have to touch these cells All we said is there, you guys should make an eye And they, they take it from there And they say, well, there's not enough of us Let's, let's get our friends to help And they, they convince and it's really a process of, of trying to basically infect them with a better world model of what they should be doing And there's a, there's actually a debate that goes on and the cells resist, but, but when they win, they, you get this, you get this beautiful eye And of course, there are many other collective intelligences that scale to problem size on their own Just to show you that you can",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses an experiment where cells are injected to form an eye within a tadpole's tail. The injected cells recruit neighboring cells to form the eye's components, such as the lens and retina. This process demonstrates cellular communication and collective intelligence.",
