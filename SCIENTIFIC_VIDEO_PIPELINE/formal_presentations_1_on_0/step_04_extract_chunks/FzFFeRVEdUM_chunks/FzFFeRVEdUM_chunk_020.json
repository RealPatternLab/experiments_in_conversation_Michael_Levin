  "text": "Okay, so in the last two minutes, what I want to show you is this. So far what I've been telling you is that we can convince living tissue to Repair or remake or reposition normal organs that they already make. And I want to show you something even further from this. The remarkable plasticity of life. So if I show you this, this video, and I ask you what, what you think this is, a reasonable guess would be that it's a primitive organism that we got from a pond somewhere. And if I ask you what the genome would be, you would guess that it has like one of these ancient genomes with these tiny little, tiny little creatures. I can tell you that this, the genome here, is 100% Homo sapiens.",
