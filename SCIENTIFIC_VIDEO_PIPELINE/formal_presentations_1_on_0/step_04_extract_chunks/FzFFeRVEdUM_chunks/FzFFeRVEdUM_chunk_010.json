  "text": "So the very first thing that has to happen is that, and as I'm going to point out, it's a bioelectrical mechanism that aligns them all together It's a bioelectrical network that allows them to remember what pattern they're supposed to build in the first place And that is what makes an embryo and an individual rather than millions and billions of cells This, by the way, has many implications in cognitive science One of the things that my lab has driven is this really development of this parallel between cognition and morphogenesis, between the formation of the body and the formation of the mind They're basically the same problem",
