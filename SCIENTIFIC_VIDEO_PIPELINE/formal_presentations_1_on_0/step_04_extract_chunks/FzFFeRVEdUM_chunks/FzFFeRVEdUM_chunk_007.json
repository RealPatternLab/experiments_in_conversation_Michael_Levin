  "text": "And then hopefully the whole system has some degree of intelligence. But life isn't like that. Every part of our body has agendas, it has competencies. This is a single cell. This is known as a lacrymaria. So just one cell, no brain, no nervous system. This thing has massive competency within its own tiny little cognitive light cone. It only cares about things with a very short spatiotemporal horizon. But put together, they can form much greater things. And of course, by the way, a lot of folks will say that, well, okay, so you're saying that intelligence goes down to the single cell level. I mean, that's weird enough, but actually it's well below that, because even the molecular networks inside of cells, never mind the cell itself, but just, just the molecular networks already have six different kinds of learning they can do, including Pavlovian conditioning. And they have. If you're interested in things like causal information theory and Tononi's models of, of phi and integrated information that some people think is associated with consciousness, those already exist here at the molecular network level. Inside of that cell, the material, the tiniest material, already has aspects of learning and integrated information. And we're making use of that by developing applications in drug conditioning and things like that to train these pathways. Nevermind the animal, nevermind the cells, but the actual molecular pathways inside. And so our bodies have this amazing nested intelligence. I call it a multi scale competency architecture where every level of organization has the ability to learn and to solve problems in different spaces. William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same goal by different means.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of intelligence at the cellular and molecular level. It emphasizes how individual cells and even molecular networks within cells have the ability to learn and adapt, forming a multi-scale competency architecture. Applications of this understanding in drug conditioning are also mentioned.",
