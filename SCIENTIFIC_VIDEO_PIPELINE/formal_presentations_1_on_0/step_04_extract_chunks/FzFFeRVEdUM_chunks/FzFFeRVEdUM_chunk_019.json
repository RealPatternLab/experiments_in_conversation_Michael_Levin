  "text": "This is a kind of a useful application where we're looking for limb regeneration Frogs, unlike that axolotl, do not regenerate their limbs, as neither do we And so 45 days later, after losing a leg, there is no regeneration normally, but if we give the cells an early signal, so it's a wearable bioreactor with some ion channel payload, it immediately tells the cells to get going 45 days later, you've got some toes, you've got a toenail, eventually a touch sensitive and functional leg The most important thing here is that like with any good cognitive system, you do not micromanage the molecules When I'm talking to you right now, I'm not worried about reaching into your brain and having to arrange all the synapses so that you remember what I've said I'm giving you information on a very thin communications channel And I'm trusting you as a high end cognitive system to do all the biochemistry downstream that's required for you to react to what I'm saying The same thing is true here This, this signal was present for 24 hours And after that we've shown a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all The goal is not to micromanage it It is not to tell the cells what to do It is not to 3D print scaffolds for stem cells None of that The goal is to convince it on day one that this is the path you should go The leg building path is the right one, not the scarring path And there you go Okay, so in the last two minutes, what I want to show you is this",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses an experiment on limb regeneration in frogs using a wearable bioreactor with an ion channel payload. The speaker emphasizes the importance of not micromanaging the process, but instead giving an initial signal and allowing the cells to follow the 'leg building' path.",
