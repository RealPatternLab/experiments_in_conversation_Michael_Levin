  "text": "This is a kind of a useful application where we're looking for limb regeneration. Frogs, unlike that axolotl, do not regenerate their limbs, as neither do we. And so 45 days later, after losing a leg, there is no regeneration normally, but if we give the cells an early signal, so it's a wearable bioreactor with some ion channel payload, it immediately tells the cells to get going. 45 days later, you've got some toes, you've got a toenail, eventually a touch sensitive and functional leg. The most important thing here is that like with any good cognitive system, you do not micromanage the molecules. When I'm talking to you right now, I'm not worried about reaching into your brain and having to arrange all the synapses so that you remember what I've said. I'm giving you information on a very thin communications channel. And I'm trusting you as a high end cognitive system to do all the biochemistry downstream that's required for you to react to what I'm saying. The same thing is true here. This, this signal was present for 24 hours. And after that we've shown a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. The goal is not to micromanage it. It is not to tell the cells what to do. It is not to 3D print scaffolds for stem cells. None of that. The goal is to convince it on day one that this is the path you should go. The leg building path is the right one, not the scarring path. And there you go. Okay, so in the last two minutes, what I want to show you is this.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the application of bioelectricity in limb regeneration. He explains how an early signal from a wearable bioreactor can initiate cell activity leading to limb growth in frogs, emphasizing that the process doesn't require micromanagement of cells but rather guiding them on the right path.",
