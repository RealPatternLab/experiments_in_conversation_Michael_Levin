  "text": "So one way that we know that this bioelectric pattern is actually the memory of this collective intelligence. So let's get back to the beginning of the talk. What I was pointing out is that there are some really weird intelligences out there that we are not familiar with. And so we use morphogenesis as one example. So groups of cells are an unconventional collective intelligence that navigates a really strange space that we cannot visualize. It's a high dimensional, anatomical, amorphous space. And our goal is to learn to communicate with that intelligence, to predict its behavior and to communicate with it and to ask it to do different things. In biomedical contexts. In order to do that, we've developed this bioelectrical interface.",
