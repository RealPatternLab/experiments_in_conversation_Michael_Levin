  "text": "So one way that we know that this bioelectric pattern is actually the memory of this collective intelligence So let's get back to the beginning of the talk What I was pointing out is that there are some really weird intelligences out there that we are not familiar with And so we use morphogenesis as one example So groups of cells are an unconventional collective intelligence that navigates a really strange space that we cannot visualize It's a high dimensional, anatomical, amorphous space And our goal is to learn to communicate with that intelligence, to predict its behavior and to communicate with it and to ask it to do different things In biomedical contexts In order to do that, we've developed this bioelectrical interface",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of bioelectric patterns as a form of collective intelligence in cells, particularly in the context of morphogenesis. He expresses the goal of learning to communicate with this intelligence, predict its behavior, and manipulate it using a bioelectrical interface, especially in biomedical contexts.",
