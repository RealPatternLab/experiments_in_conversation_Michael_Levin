  "text": "So, so here's a word that actually GPT4 came up with this word for me, synthbiosis. This idea that we are going to have to get better at recognizing other minds and ethically relating to them so that we can all have a more positive embodiment. And this is, this is what I think the future, the Garden of Eden is going to really look like. It's going to be very weird. And it is on us actually to really understand what we're dealing with. Xenobots and anthrobots and augmented humans and chimeras of all kinds, we are really going to have to raise our game. Because the things that used to work. What do you look like and where and how did you get here? Meaning factory versus a trial and error of evolution. Those categories are not going to be any good anymore.",
