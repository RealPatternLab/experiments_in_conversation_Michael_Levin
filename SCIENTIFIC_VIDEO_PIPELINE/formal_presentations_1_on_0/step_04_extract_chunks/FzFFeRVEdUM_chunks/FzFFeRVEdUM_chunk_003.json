  "text": "But more importantly, there's now an additional continuum, which means that both in biological, along the biological axis, but also the technological axis, you can make slow and gradual changes and get progressively further and further from this archetype. Again, what we need in science and philosophy are stories of transformation, not magical categories such as a real human or proof of humanity certificates or any of that stuff that people talk about. We are really at a place where we now understand none of that works. What I think is really interesting is an analogy to the electromagnetic spectrum. So back in the day before we had a mature theory of electromagnetism, we had lightning and we had static electricity, and we had light, and we had magnets and various other phenomena. And we thought those were all different things. And not only did we think those are all different things, but we were actually only directly sensitive to an extremely narrow part of this whole spectrum.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of a continuum in both biological and technological aspects, emphasizing the importance of transformation stories in science and philosophy over rigid categories. An analogy is drawn to the electromagnetic spectrum, highlighting how our understanding has evolved from viewing different phenomena as separate to recognizing them as part of a broader spectrum.",
