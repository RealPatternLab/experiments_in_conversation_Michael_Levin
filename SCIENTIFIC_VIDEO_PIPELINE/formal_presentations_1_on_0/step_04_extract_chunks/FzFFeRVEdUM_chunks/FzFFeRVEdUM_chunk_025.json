  "text": "So I'm going to skip all this. We don't have time. And just, and just point out that there's some amazing people that need to get the credit for all the things that I showed you today. So these are my postdocs and my grad students. We have lots of remarkable collaborators. Our funders disclosures. So these are three spin off companies from our work that support our research right now. And all the biggest thanks go to the model systems because they do all the heavy lifting and teaching us about this stuff. So I will stop here and thank you for listening.",
