  "text": "This is what I'm interested in. I'm interested in developing a framework where we can see how you get all the way from quote unquote passive matter. And by the way, I'm no longer sure there is any such thing. And all the way up to human level and beyond of metacognitive kinds of minds. These are the things I want to understand together as being on the same spectrum. Not just mammals and birds, but all kinds of weird organisms, including things that are not even themselves physical, such as patterns within media. I think we need this not only for biomedical and bioengineering applications, but because this is really, I think, a profoundly important step towards an ethics of a mature species that has some chance of survival long term, meaning us. Okay, so the first thing I want to remind us all of is that we all start life as a single cell.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, expresses interest in understanding the spectrum from passive matter to metacognitive minds, including non-physical entities like patterns within media. He emphasizes the importance of this understanding for biomedical and bioengineering applications, and for the long-term survival of our species. He reminds the audience that life starts from a single cell.",
