  "text": "So just to end. Because life is a problem solving process from the beginning. Almost any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent. Life is incredibly interoperable. So hybrids and cyborgs and chimeras of every kind all make use of these ingressing patterns, which is a whole other thing we could talk about from, from mathematics and computation that create viable beings. Everything that Darwin saw when he said endless forms, most beautiful meaning natural life is a tiny little blip here on this enormous space of beings with whom we are going to share our world. Many of these things already exist. Many more are forthcoming. And what we need is to.",
