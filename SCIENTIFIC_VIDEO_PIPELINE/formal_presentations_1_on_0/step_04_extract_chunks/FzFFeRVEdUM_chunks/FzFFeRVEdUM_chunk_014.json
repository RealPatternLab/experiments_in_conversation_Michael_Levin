  "text": "But. But what happens with this, with this eye is that it makes an optic nerve. That optic nerve does not go to the brain. It synapses on the spinal cord or sometimes on the gut, sometimes nowhere at all. And the most amazing thing about it is that these animals can see. And we know because we built this device that trains them for visual learning tasks and they can see perfectly well. So this is shocking. Why does it not take additional rounds of mutation and selection to radically change this animal's sensory motor architecture and make things work? You don't need it. It works out of the box. And it works out of the box because that process where all of the cells, every single time, you can call it beginner's mind, where every single time they have to solve the problem of what are we, what are we going to build and where are we going to go? And it is never obvious to them or assumed that they are what they are. The story that the genetics tells you, what you're going to be, is not the right story at all. That instead what the genetics builds is a problem solving agent that is very creative in interpreting its environment and interpreting the genetics that have been passed down to it. That's why. And I could do hours on just examples of creative problem solving where you don't need additional rounds of mutation to. Because the material never thought it was going to be a perfect tadpole in the first place, it's able to adapt to all kinds of novel manipulations. I kept mentioning this word bioelectricity.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses an unusual case where an animal's optic nerve does not connect to the brain but still allows the animal to see. This is attributed to the animal's cells' ability to creatively interpret their environment and genetics, negating the need for additional rounds of mutation and selection. The speaker emphasizes the role of bioelectricity in these processes.",
