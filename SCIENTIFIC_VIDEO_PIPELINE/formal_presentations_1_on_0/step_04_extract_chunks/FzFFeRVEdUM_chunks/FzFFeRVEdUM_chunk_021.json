  "text": "This is perfectly normal human, adult human cells. They have not been manipulated with any synthetic biology circuits. There are no scaffolds here. There are no transgenes. There's no genomic editing. What this is, is taking cells from an adult human patient, tracheal epithelial cells actually from their airway, and giving them a chance to have another lease on life, to reboot their multicellularity. The original patient may or may not be alive, but the cells in a slightly different environment, not that different actually, but, but liberated from the rest of the body, could have this completely novel, novel life, okay? And you would not know that by looking at it, but actually, this is this because, because this doesn't look like any stage of human development, okay?",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the potential of adult human cells, specifically tracheal epithelial cells, to be rejuvenated or reprogrammed without the use of synthetic biology circuits, transgenes, or genomic editing. The cells, when removed from the body and placed in a slightly different environment, can exhibit novel characteristics not typically seen in any stage of human development.",
