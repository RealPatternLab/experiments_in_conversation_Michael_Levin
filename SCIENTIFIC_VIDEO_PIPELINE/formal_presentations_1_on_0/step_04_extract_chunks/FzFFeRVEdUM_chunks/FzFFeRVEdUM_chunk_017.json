  "text": "So now we can directly read. Now decoding them is a whole other matter, but we can directly read the memory states of this intelligence. And we could try to rewrite new, give it new ideas. Well, what kind of idea could you give it? Well, one thing you might say is that, you know, a proper tadpole should really have an eye on its tail, on its. On its gut, in this case. And so the way you would do that is by injecting RNA that encodes a particular channel, ion channel, protein, in this case a potassium channel. And what you would do is establish a little voltage state here that says to the surrounding cells, you should build an eye. Okay, how did we know? 10 years of work trying to understand how the cells interpret these voltage gradients.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the ability to read and potentially alter the 'memory states' of cells, suggesting the possibility of instructing cells to build new structures, such as an eye on a tadpole's tail, through the injection of RNA that encodes specific ion channels. This concept is based on a decade of research into how cells interpret voltage gradients.",
