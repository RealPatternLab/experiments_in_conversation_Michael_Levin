  "text": "So now we can directly read Now decoding them is a whole other matter, but we can directly read the memory states of this intelligence And we could try to rewrite new, give it new ideas Well, what kind of idea could you give it Well, one thing you might say is that, you know, a proper tadpole should really have an eye on its tail, on its On its gut, in this case And so the way you would do that is by injecting RNA that encodes a particular channel, ion channel, protein, in this case a potassium channel And what you would do is establish a little voltage state here that says to the surrounding cells, you should build an eye Okay, how did we know 10 years of work trying to understand how the cells interpret these voltage gradients",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the ability to read and potentially modify cellular memory states, using the example of instructing cells to build an eye in an unconventional location on a tadpole. This is achieved by injecting RNA that encodes a specific ion channel protein, creating a voltage state that communicates the new instruction to surrounding cells.",
