  "text": "So no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, but the collective absolutely does. And you know that here, you know that it does a means ends analysis here to get back to where it needs to be once you've deviated. But this whole thing is not just about damage. It's not about just fixing this kind of surgical defect. It also allows you to do these amazing things. So here's a tadpole that we made. What you'll notice is there's no eyes where the eyes belong, but instead. So, so here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, the gut. There's no eyes, but we put an eye on its tail. And it's a whole story. I could tell you about how we do it.",
