  "text": "So no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, but the collective absolutely does. And you know that here, you know that it does a means ends analysis here to get back to where it needs to be once you've deviated. But this whole thing is not just about damage. It's not about just fixing this kind of surgical defect. It also allows you to do these amazing things. So here's a tadpole that we made. What you'll notice is there's no eyes where the eyes belong, but instead. So, so here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, the gut. There's no eyes, but we put an eye on its tail. And it's a whole story. I could tell you about how we do it.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of collective intelligence in cells, highlighting how they work together to form complex structures such as fingers. They also discuss an experiment where they bioengineered a tadpole to have an eye on its tail, demonstrating the potential of regenerative biology and bioengineering.",
