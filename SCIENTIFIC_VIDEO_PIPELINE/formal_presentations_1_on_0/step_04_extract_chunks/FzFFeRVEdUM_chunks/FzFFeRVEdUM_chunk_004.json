  "text": "So, so what, what, what, what happened? We, we acquired a good theory of electromagnetism and that allowed us to do several things. First of all, it allowed us to understand that things that we think of as quite different are actually the same thing. They are different expressions of the same underlying dynamics. So an incredibly powerful unification. And then it allowed us to build technologies and to realize that while we are directly only sensitive here, that's just a contingent fact of our evolutionary history. In fact, with tools, with the right equipment, we are now we can become sensitive to all of this stuff. And of course there are many applications. And so, and so this is what I'm really interested, I'm really interested in creating tools, conceptual tools, but and also practical bench tools. Because the implications of the work that I'm describing here have very practical kinds of effects on things like birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer medicine, bioengineering, and so on. What we want are tools that allow us to see across the spectrum of minds, that is to fight the kind of mind blindness that we have by default. Because we are, because of our evolutionary history, we're hyper fixated on three dimensional space and sort of medium sized objects moving in three dimensional space as intelligent beings.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the impact of understanding electromagnetism, which has led to the development of tools that have practical implications in areas such as birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer medicine, and bioengineering. He emphasizes the importance of these tools in overcoming our natural limitations due to our evolutionary history, which restricts our perception to three-dimensional space.",
