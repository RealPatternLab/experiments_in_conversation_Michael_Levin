  "text": "So, so what, what, what, what happened We, we acquired a good theory of electromagnetism and that allowed us to do several things First of all, it allowed us to understand that things that we think of as quite different are actually the same thing They are different expressions of the same underlying dynamics So an incredibly powerful unification And then it allowed us to build technologies and to realize that while we are directly only sensitive here, that's just a contingent fact of our evolutionary history In fact, with tools, with the right equipment, we are now we can become sensitive to all of this stuff And of course there are many applications And so, and so this is what I'm really interested, I'm really interested in creating tools, conceptual tools, but and also practical bench tools Because the implications of the work that I'm describing here have very practical kinds of effects on things like birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer medicine, bioengineering, and so on What we want are tools that allow us to see across the spectrum of minds, that is to fight the kind of mind blindness that we have by default Because we are, because of our evolutionary history, we're hyper fixated on three dimensional space and sort of medium sized objects moving in three dimensional space as intelligent beings",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the importance of understanding electromagnetism, which has led to a unification of seemingly different phenomena. He emphasizes the development of tools to expand our sensory perception beyond our evolutionary limitations. The implications of this work could have practical effects on fields like birth defects, regenerative medicine, and cancer medicine.",
