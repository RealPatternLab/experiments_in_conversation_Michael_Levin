  "text": "So it is not the case that mammals are somehow unable to regenerate. But our capacities at present, and I do think this is changeable, are not as good as those of certain other organisms. Now, we've been studying for some years how it is that this happens. How does a collection of cells know what to build and when to stop? And we took our inspiration from the nervous system, which is basically a collection of cells that guide your body through behavioral space using, using memories and goals and so on. Exactly the same thing, it turns out, happens in anatomical space.",

They also draw a parallel between the function of the nervous system and the behavior of cells in anatomical space, suggesting that cells may have a form of 'memory' and 'goals' that guide their behavior.",
