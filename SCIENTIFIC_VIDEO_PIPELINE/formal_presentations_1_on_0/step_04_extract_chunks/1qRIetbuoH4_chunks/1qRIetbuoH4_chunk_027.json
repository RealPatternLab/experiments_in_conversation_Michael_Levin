  "text": "This is the mark of a good collective intelligence. Like ants and termites. When there's a task that's too big for the individuals that have started on it, they will recruit their neighbors to all work together. So again, we didn't have to orchestrate any of this. This is already, this competency is already in. So discovering these subroutines and discovering the various competencies and the abilities of these networks to restore the correct structure and function with minimal intervention, with minimal tweaks is the name of the game here. Moving to the regenerative part in a frog, unlike salamander, if it loses a leg 45 days later, there's nothing. Although interestingly, once you do the amputation, the opposite leg lights up bioelectrically within 30 seconds, it lights up at exactly the location where the damage took place. The whole body knows about this and you can think of about this is surrogate site diagnostics and things like this. Already you can read out where the damage was.",
