  "text": "This is literally the way that people read the memories of a brain. By looking at the electrical activity, we can now read the memories of the collective intelligence of the body. And so what we can see is that once you've rewritten what the system encodes as the correct morphology, well, it will continue to build this new morphology as far as we can tell, forever. And that we now also have a way of changing them back to be one headed. Now I'll show you one other example and then we'll get to some of the biomedical stuff and the bio robotics.",
