  "text": "So now there are two really important pieces to this. One is that this is not a 3D printer. The point is not to micromanage the position of every cell and try to assemble something complex piece by piece. It is also not anything to do with genomic editing or CRISPR or anything like that. This is fundamentally the right way to think about this is as a communications device. This system and the AI that will make it possible is for translating our anatomical and functional goals to the goals of a collective intelligence of cells that are going to build this thing.",
