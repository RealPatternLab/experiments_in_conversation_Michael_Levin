  "text": "But the other thing is that there are other hidden competencies here. For example, this is a lens sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. And the blue cells are the ones that we injected with this potassium channel. And so they go to make an eye, but there's not enough of them. There's only a few of them. What do they do? They recruit a bunch of their normal cells which are not blue. That's how you know, we have not manipulated them. And these brown and clear cells participate because these cells hijack them. They recruit them towards this goal.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses an experiment where a lens in a tadpole's flank was injected with a potassium channel. Despite the limited number of manipulated cells, these cells were able to recruit normal cells to participate in the formation of an eye, demonstrating a hidden competency in bioelectricity and developmental biology.",
