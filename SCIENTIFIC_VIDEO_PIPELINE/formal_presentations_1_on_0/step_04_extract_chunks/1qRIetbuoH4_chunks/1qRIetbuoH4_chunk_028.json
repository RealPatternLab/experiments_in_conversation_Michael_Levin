  "text": "Now what we did was we came up with a cocktail of ion channel drugs that induces regeneration. So here the pro regenerative genes come on. Within 45 days, you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail. Eventually you have a very nice leg and it's touch sensitive and it's motile. What we found is that one day. So 24 hours of a wearable bioreactor made by David Kaplan's lab with the right payload gives you 18 months, a year and a half of leg growth, during which time we don't touch it at all. This is not about 3D printing.",

This process is facilitated by a wearable bioreactor developed by David Kaplan's lab, which only requires 24 hours of use to initiate the long-term growth.",
