  "text": "Now we don't have anything remotely like that. We can only do this sort of thing in very Few specific cases, but I wanted to lay out the opportunity ahead. This is the kind of the roadmap. So one of the. So why don't we have this. Genetics and molecular biology have been doing great over for decades. Why don't we have an anatomical compiler? Well, let's just remind ourselves that we all start life as a group of cells and these embryonic blastomeres reliably build something like this. So this is a cross section through a human torso. You can see the incredible complexity of all the tissues, organs, everything is in the right place relative to each other. And so the question is, where does this shape come from? Where is this order stored? Where is it recorded? And you might think, well, the genome, everything's in the genome.",
