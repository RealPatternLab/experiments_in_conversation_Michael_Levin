  "text": "In other words, we cannot use familiar criteria of where did you come from? Meaning evolved or designed? And what are you made of? Meaning, do you have a brain, does it look human, that kind of thing? Those criteria are going to be out the window. Everything that Darwin meant when he said endless forms, most beautiful are a tiny corner in this enormous option space, Possible bodies and possible minds. And so I will just end with this by saying that there's some, there's some very deep new ideas coming in in the space of biomedical interventions rooted in this kind of idea by Fabrizio Benedetti, who studies placebo effects, which is that really what you have here is the role of top down cognitive information on molecular events. You do that every time you get up out of bed every morning. Your intention, your mental intention of getting up feeds down into the molecular properties of your muscle cell membranes that make you get up. The idea, especially using bioelectricity as this transduction layer, that software layer between the intelligence and the actual execution machinery and AI to actually manage this, gives us a whole range of strategies here that are in complement to all the successful kind of mainstream strategies.",
