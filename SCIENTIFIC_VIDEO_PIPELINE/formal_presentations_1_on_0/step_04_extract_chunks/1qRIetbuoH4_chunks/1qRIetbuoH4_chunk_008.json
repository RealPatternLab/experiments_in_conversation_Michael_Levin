  "text": "But reversing this is extremely hard. To give you a very simple example from for example, the fractals, this is a simple mathematical formula. It's very short, very simple. If you iterate it and plot the kind of a version of the Julia set, you will get this very complex pattern. But now, and so that's great. Going forward is easy going. Starting with the rules and getting something complex is very simple, but going backwards. If I, if you were a worker in regenerative medicine, you said, well, this thing isn't quite symmetrical. And by the way, I don't want three of these, I want four. How would you have to change the formula? It's, there is no, there's no way to do that.",
