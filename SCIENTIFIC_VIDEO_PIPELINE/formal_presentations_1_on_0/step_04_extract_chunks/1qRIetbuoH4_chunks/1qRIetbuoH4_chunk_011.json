  "text": "And it's possible because biology, unlike most of our technology, I sometimes give a different talk of why robots don't get cancer. And the reason that biology is so special and there's no reason why we couldn't emulate this, is that it uses a multi scale competency architecture. The idea is that at every level, so from molecular networks to cells, to tissues, to whole bodies, whether in behavioral space or anatomical space, or even collectives, each of these layers solves its own problems. They are not just structural, they are problem solving systems that operate or navigate in the space of gene expression, the space of physiology, the space of anatomy, and of course three dimensional behavioral space, in our case also linguistic spaces and so on. And they all have different levels of sophistication and different competencies to do this.",
