  "text": "Now the solution to these problems we call the anatomical compiler. So the idea is that at some point in the future the you will be able to sit down in front of a computer and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have. So you would draw the three dimensional structure, the anatomy, not the molecular biology of it, but actually the anatomy of what you want. And this system would compile that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build whatever you want. And in this case, here's this like three headed flatworm. I'll show you some flatworms in a minute.",

This system would translate the anatomical design into cellular stimuli to instruct cells to build the organism, exemplified by a three-headed flatworm.",
