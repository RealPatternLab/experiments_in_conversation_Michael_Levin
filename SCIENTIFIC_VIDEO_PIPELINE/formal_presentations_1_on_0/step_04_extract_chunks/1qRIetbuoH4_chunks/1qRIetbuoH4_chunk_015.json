  "text": "So this now tells you that this kind of thing is some sort of a navigation policy in this anatomical space. It's an error minimization scheme where errors like this become corrected over time. And when the error is small, small enough, then they stop. So we really need to understand this ability, this ability to navigate. So all the tools of autonomous self driving, various vehicles and all of this, the kind of control theory stuff from engineering and AI becomes very relevant here. Now, this is not just for salamanders and worms. I'm going to show you in a minute. Mammals do this too. Humans regenerate their livers. Human children regenerate their fingertips. Up until a certain age, if you just leave it alone, an amputated fingertip actually becomes cosmetically a very nice finger. And deer are a large adult mammal that regrows basically meters of new bone, vasculature, innervation, and so on. And it does it every year, and it does it at a rate of about a centimeter and a half of new bone per day.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of bioelectricity in regeneration, likening it to an error minimization scheme in which errors are corrected over time. This concept is not only applicable to simple organisms but also to mammals, including humans. The speaker also highlights the rapid regeneration capabilities of deer, which regrow large amounts of bone annually.",
