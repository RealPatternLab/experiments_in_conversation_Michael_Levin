  "text": "So that's it. Just to summarize what I've said, the rate limiting step in truly transformative technologies are the communication of goals to cellular swarms. Not just the molecular details, but actually the algorithms of life. And we have a roadmap for exploiting the native computation and the competencies of living networks. Bioelectrical signaling is a really crucial protocognitive medium of that collective intelligence. And we now have tools that appropriate all kinds of deep concepts from neuroscience to help us understand this in other contexts. And at stake are a huge number of really transformative applications. And so I'll just, I'll end here by thanking the postdocs and the students who did all the work, our funders, and most of all the animal model systems, because they do all the heavy lifting. And then once again, there's some disclosures that I need to make, so thank you very much.",
