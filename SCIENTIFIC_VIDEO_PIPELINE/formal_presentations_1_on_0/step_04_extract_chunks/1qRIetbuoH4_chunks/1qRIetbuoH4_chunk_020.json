  "text": "This is where the mouth is going to be. The animal's left eye comes in later. This is the placodes out to the side that give rise to all kinds of tissues. Already you can read the electrical pattern memory that's going to guide what happens next. I'm going to show you in a minute how we know that this is actually an instructive set of interactions. But this is a normal pattern. This is required for normal development. This is a pathological pattern. Here we've injected a human oncogene into an embryo. Eventually it's going to make a tumor. Eventually the tumor will metastasize.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the role of bioelectricity and electrical pattern memory in embryonic development, particularly in tissue formation and the establishment of body parts such as the mouth and eyes. It also explores the impact of injecting a human oncogene into an embryo, leading to tumor formation and eventual metastasis.",
