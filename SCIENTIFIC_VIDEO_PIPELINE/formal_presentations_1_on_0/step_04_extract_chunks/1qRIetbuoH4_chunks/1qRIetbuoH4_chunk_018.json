  "text": "So there's this, there's this notion of neural decoding where you can scan a brain, decode it somehow and figure out what the animal is thinking about or looking at. And there's been some success in this, both in humans and model systems. The amazing thing is that brains and neurons didn't learn this trick on their own or didn't invent it from scratch. This is something that living systems have been doing since the time of bacterial biofilms back already that long ago. Evolution discovered that electrical networks are amazing at storing and processing information. Every cell in your body has these ion channels. And figuring out what is a neuron and what isn't is actually not trivial at all. Most cells are connected to their neighbors with these electrical synapses. And what you can do is you can look at early embryos or regenerating limbs or anything else using the same techniques, basically electrical imaging, and try to do the same decoding program. You could ask, could we learn to decode to understand what the cells are saying to each other and then to rewrite those patterns and get them to build something else.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of neural decoding, the ability to interpret brain activity to understand thought processes. It highlights the evolutionary development of bioelectricity, emphasizing the role of ion channels and electrical synapses in cell communication. The speaker suggests that these principles could be applied to understand and potentially manipulate cellular communication in early embryos or regenerating limbs.",
