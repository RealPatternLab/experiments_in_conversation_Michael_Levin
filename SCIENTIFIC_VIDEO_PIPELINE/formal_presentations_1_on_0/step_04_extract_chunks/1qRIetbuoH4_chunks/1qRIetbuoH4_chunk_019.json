  "text": "This is what we've been working on to show you very quickly, just two examples of these bioelectrical patterns. This is using a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye. Here. The grayscale colors represent a voltage of the cells. This is a time lapse movie of an early frog embryo putting its face together. Now, one thing you'll note, this is a frame, one frame out of that movie. We call this the electric face. Why? Because already before the genes come on that are going to pattern this whole structure, already you can see this is where the eye is going to be.",
