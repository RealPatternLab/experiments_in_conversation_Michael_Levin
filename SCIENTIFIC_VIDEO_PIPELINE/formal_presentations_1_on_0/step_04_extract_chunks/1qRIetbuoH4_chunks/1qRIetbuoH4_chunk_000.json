  "text": "Is interested in any of the details, the software, the data sets, or getting in touch with me. This is the website where everything is. And so what we're going to talk about is the opportunities around bioelectricity and in general around cellular collective intelligence in biorobotics, regenerative medicine and so on. So the design challenge that we have is, can be summed up as the total rational control of growth and form. And what I mean by that is that if we had the ability to tell groups of cells what to build in terms of three dimensional anatomical structure, many medical problems, in fact most medical problems would go away.",
