  "text": "But this is the frontier. The frontier is understanding how large scale collective decisions are being made that determine our anatomy and our, and our function. Now the bad news is that by themselves, these very important technologies such as genomic editing and molecular biology are not going to give us everything that we want. Because this process of going from a single cell egg to one of these complex bodies is this, this, this morphogenetic process is incredibly complex and recurrent. In other words, all of these cells are doing various things and together there's, they end up building something like this.",
