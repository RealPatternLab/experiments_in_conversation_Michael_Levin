  "text": "So obviously this is a technology that we're developing for in the body repair. It's made of your own cells. You won't need immunosuppression once we figure out how to ask these cells to do the things we want them to do. This is all kinds of useful technology. But the other important thing about this is that first of all, they have four different discrete behaviors. And you can draw an ethogram of those transition states between those behaviors like you would in any animal. They have a drastically remodeled transcriptome. What I mean by that is this volcano plot shows different genes that they express differently than the tissue they came from. Each one of these red genes, there are about 9,000 of them.",

The cells exhibit four distinct behaviors, and their transcriptome, or the set of all RNA molecules, is drastically remodeled, expressing different genes than the tissue they originated from.",
