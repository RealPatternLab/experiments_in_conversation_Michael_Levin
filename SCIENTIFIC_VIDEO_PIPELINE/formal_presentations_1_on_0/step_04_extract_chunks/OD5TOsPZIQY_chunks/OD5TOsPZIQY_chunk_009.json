  "text": "So things like split brain patients, dissociative identity disorders, how many individuals are within a given set of real estate in the brain and how many can actually fit? What's the maximum carrying capacity? We know this for standard computation. We do not know how to calculate this for neural substrates. And so it's incredibly dynamic process, self making. Literally self making is a very dynamic process and it's driven by this sort of thing. This is what we are all made of. This is a single cell. Now this is a free living organism, but you get the idea. It's a single cell. There's no brain, there's no nervous system. There is, however, great competency in managing its own tiny little cognitive light cone. The spatiotemporal region of goals that it can pursue is small, but, but it's very good at doing what it, what it needs to do. And even this, I mean, a lot of people are now catching on that, that cells have a kind of, kind of intelligence and competency and whatever.",
