  "text": "But we are, for example, in our lab, taking advantage of the ability of these molecular networks to learn to make Applications such as drug conditioning and things like that. So our body is a multiscale competency architecture. Every level, from the molecular networks on up, is a kind of agent that solves problems in various weird spaces. And because of our evolutionary firmware, we are pretty good at recognizing intelligence in three dimensional space. You know, we're obsessed with the 3D world because of our vision and medium sized objects moving at medium speeds, like birds and things like this, we can sort of pick that up.",
