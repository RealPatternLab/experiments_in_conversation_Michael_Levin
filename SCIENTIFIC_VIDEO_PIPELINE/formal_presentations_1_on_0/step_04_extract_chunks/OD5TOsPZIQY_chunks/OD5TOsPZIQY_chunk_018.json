And you say, okay, this is a sign of cognition and consciousness. Or you're looking at evolutionary continuity. You say, well, they're on the same evolutionary stream and therefore they must have had it too. If you like any of these criteria, then you have to take very seriously the idea that every structure in your body potentially has some sort of likely non verbal and so you don't hear from it, but, but",
