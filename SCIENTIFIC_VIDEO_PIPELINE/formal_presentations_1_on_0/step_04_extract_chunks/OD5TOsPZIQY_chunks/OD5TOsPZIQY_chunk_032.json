  "text": "So so, so now, now we can start to ask, okay, so what does this have to do with biology? Could we, could we find any living forms without a large scale history? In other words, if biologists will say that, that whatever form you have is driven by your evolutionary history, are there any for any beings that, that are picking up forms that cannot be explained in this way? So I'm going to show you just one. This is something called an anthrobot. If I showed it to you for the first time, you may have already seen this. If you saw this for the first time, you might be tempted to guess that this is some sort of primitive organism that we picked up at the bottom of a pond somewhere. You might take a guess about its genome. You might think that, well, this will have an early genome of an early metazoan.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of evolutionary biology and how it influences the form of living beings. He introduces the term 'anthrobot', a presumably primitive organism, and speculates about its genome, suggesting it might be similar to that of an early metazoan.",
