  "text": "So I think the future, future medicine is not going to look like chemistry. It's going to look a lot more like a kind of somatic psychiatry. Bioelectrics is one interface Layer. No doubt there are others. There are, you know, biophotons and other, other things that probably will be developed. But, but I think the most well developed at this point is bioelectricity. So now we can ask. Okay, so, so if the future of all of this is really the study of patterns, it's the study of patterns of thought and behavior that occur in these weird media such as, such as the electrical networks of your body, where do these patterns come from? And the standard answer in biology is, well, they come from two places. Biologists love two kinds of explanations for things. One is history.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, suggests that the future of medicine will not be based on chemistry but will resemble somatic psychiatry, with bioelectricity being a key interface layer. He emphasizes the importance of studying patterns, particularly those found in the body's electrical networks, and discusses the origins of these patterns in biological terms.",
