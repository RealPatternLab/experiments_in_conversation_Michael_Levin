  "text": "But, but it's not just that this goes down to the cell level. No, it's, it goes far beyond that because even the chemical material inside of that cell, not the cell itself, not the nucleus, not any of that. But, but, but, but just the chemical pathways, for example, gene regulatory networks or other, other, just from the way the math works, they are themselves capable of at least six different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning. You don't need anything else. Just a set of interacting chemicals is already potentially capable of several different kinds of learning already. Not only are we collective intelligences made of cells, but actually the cells themselves are collective intelligence made up of components that do all kinds of interesting things that I don't have time to talk about today.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of cellular intelligence, emphasizing that not only are organisms collective intelligences made of cells, but the cells themselves are collective intelligences made up of components. He further explains that the chemical pathways within cells, specifically gene regulatory networks, are capable of several types of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning.",
