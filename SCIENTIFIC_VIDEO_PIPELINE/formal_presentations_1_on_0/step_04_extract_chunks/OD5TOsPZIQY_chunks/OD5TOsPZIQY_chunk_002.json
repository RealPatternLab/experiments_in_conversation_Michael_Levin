  "text": "First of all, it revealed that all of these different things are in fact manifestations of the same thing, and that it is a spectrum and that the labels we put on this spectrum are convenient, but they're for our purposes. The underlying thing is a continuum. And it allowed us to develop a technology driven by the theory that now lets us interact with this enormous range of things in the universe around us, to which we were previously basically completely blind, and that allows us to make applications that improve quite quality of life. So I want to argue that this, this, this idea, the idea of a unification that reveals a spectrum and an underlying symmetry to, to, to seemingly disparate phenomena is in fact the, the exact way we should start thinking about diverse kinds of minds.",
