  "text": "Now there's something very important here, which is that when I'm talking to you all, I don't need to worry about reaching in and making sure that all your synaptic connections are doing the right biochemical things so that you remember what I'm saying. You are going to take care of all of that because you're a multi scale cognitive system. All I need to do is give you prompts with a very thin linguistic interface and then you will do all the hard work of arranging the internals of your brain to, to, to, to act accordingly. The same thing is true here. We provide a very simple signal. It's a prompt. It says make an eye. We don't tell the cells what to do. We don't tell which genes to turn on and off. We don't talk to the stem cells. We, in fact, we have no idea how to actually make an eye any more than I have any idea of how to manipulate your synapses so that you remember what I'm saying. The system takes care of all of that because it is a multiscale cognitive agent that takes high level information and it handles all the stuff downstream, including, if we only get a few cells here, they will do the job of telling their neighbors.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of multiscale cognitive systems, using the analogy of human communication to explain how cells can be prompted to perform complex tasks, such as creating an eye, without explicit instructions for each step. He emphasizes that the system itself can handle the downstream processes.",
