  "text": "But more generally, what evolution, I think has done is to pivot some of the same navigational tricks across all kinds of spaces as life got more complex. So from metabolic spaces, physiological spaces, gene expression spaces, eventually multicellularity, and you get anatomical amorphous space, then muscles and brains appear and you've got 3D behavioral space and then eventually linguistic spaces, and who knows what else. But the interesting thing here is that what our brains are using to embody conventional Cognition is exactly the same molecular mechanisms, meaning ion channels, electrical synapses and neurotransmitters. Exactly the same machinery as the collective intelligence of the body uses to make anatomical decisions. And so this is interesting. I don't plan to talk about consciousness too much in this talk, but just, just when I give these kinds of talks, I remind people that when you attribute consciousness to other humans that you're talking to or other beings, you typically use one of three criteria.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses how evolution has led to the development of complex life forms, from metabolic and physiological spaces to multicellularity and beyond. They highlight that the same molecular mechanisms, such as ion channels, electrical synapses, and neurotransmitters, are used in cognition and the collective intelligence of the body for making anatomical decisions.",
