  "text": "In other words, a history of selection. The pattern is what it is because everything else died out. And this is what we have now. So in other words, there's a historical explanation for why this pattern, not some other pattern. And the other thing the biologists like is physics. In other words, patterns are constrained by physical effects and the properties of the physical world. And so some of those patterns just come from the physics. So what's interesting though is that there are some patterns, and we can start with the one studied by mathematicians, that have neither a genetic nor an environmental explanation.",
