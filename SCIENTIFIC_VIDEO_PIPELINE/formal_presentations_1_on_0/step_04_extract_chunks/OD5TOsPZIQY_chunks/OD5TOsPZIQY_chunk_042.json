  "text": "So nothing is a machine. But some things look like the machines, like a machine to lazy observers. And I think for exactly the same reason that the rules of biochemistry don't encompass the story of the human mind. Formal models of algorithms and materials do not encompass the story of minimal beings. So really, I think we have to get much wider in our perception of what we can relate with. So I'll just, I'm going to end here and just thank the people who did the work that I showed you. Here's some postdocs and students and collaborators in our lab and disclosures are three companies that have spun off from the work that we do. And of course, thank our funders and the model systems because they've done the most hard work in teaching us about this stuff.",
