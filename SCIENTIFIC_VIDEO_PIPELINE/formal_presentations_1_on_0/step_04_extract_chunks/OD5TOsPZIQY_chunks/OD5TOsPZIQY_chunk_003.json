  "text": "So in my group, what I would like to do is to develop a framework that helps us to recognize and ethically relate to a very wide range of beings. And so not just the primates and birds and maybe an octopus or conventionally we think about, but also some really weird biological, such as colonial organisms and swarms, synthetic new life forms, AIs, whether robotic or purely software, someday maybe exobiological alien entities and some even very weird things. That I probably won't have time to really talk about today, which aren't even conventional physical objects. And I think what we have here is exactly this kind of spectrum where we have names for different types of agents along the spectrum all the way from passive matter. And I'm not sure there is any such thing.",
