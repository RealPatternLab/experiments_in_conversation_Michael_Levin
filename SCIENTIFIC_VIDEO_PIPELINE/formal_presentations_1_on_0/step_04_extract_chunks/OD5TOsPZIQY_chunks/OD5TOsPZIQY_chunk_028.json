  "text": "So just to kind of recap, what I've showed you is that this bioelectrical interface allows you to detect, reset and communicate with a very unconventional collective intelligence. And what it does is think about how to move an anatomical configuration through the space of anatomical possibilities. And if we had more time, I could show you a whole bunch of different problem solving kind of competencies that it has along those lines. So all of this kind of way of thinking about it suggests to me a different kind of biomedicine. So everything that we do today is mostly bottom up. It's focused on the hardware here. If we actually focus not only on the software, but actually on the intelligence inside the agential material of life, you end up with all kinds of applications. Most of this I didn't get to show you as far as training cells and tissues and top down communication via, via electroceuticals and things like that.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the bioelectrical interface's ability to detect, reset, and communicate with a collective intelligence, which can navigate through various anatomical possibilities. He suggests a shift from a bottom-up to a top-down approach in biomedicine, focusing on the intelligence within the agential material of life, leading to potential applications such as training cells and tissues and utilizing electroceuticals.",
