  "text": "But, but, but we tend to think of the kinds of things that physics studies as sort of passive dumb materials all the way up to whatever humans are with their metacognitive abilities and everything in between. And so, and so what I'm interested in are theories of transformation and change. Not, not sort of sharp categories, but, but actually how things scale along this continuum. And all the details are here. One thing to remember is that as we study these kinds of things, what I think we are working up along is this kind of spectrum where things get progressively weirder as you start to leave this conventional area. The kinds of agents that we think about get stranger and stranger. And one other precedent that we have is in the discovery of numbers.",
