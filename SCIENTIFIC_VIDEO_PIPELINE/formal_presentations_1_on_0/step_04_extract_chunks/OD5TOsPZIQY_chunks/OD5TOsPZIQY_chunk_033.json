  "text": "For example, if you were actually sequenced, this genome, you would find out that it's 100% Homo sapiens. These anthrobots are self assembled from adult human cells. They come from tracheal epithelia that human patients donate. Some of these patients are alive and well when they donate this, some are not. So for those that are not, this is a weird kind of life after death where these cells self assemble into a motile little organism. It matches no stage of normal human development. You would not be able to guess from the human genome that this is what you would get. Actually, you wouldn't even guess from the genome that the human body is what you would get.",

Despite their human genetic makeup, these entities do not match any stage of normal human development, illustrating the complex relationship between a genome and the physical form it can produce.",
