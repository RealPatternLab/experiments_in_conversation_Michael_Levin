  "text": "But you certainly wouldn't know this. So it's interesting. What capacities does this creature have? It's never existed on Earth before. There have never been any anthropods. There's never been any selection to have to be a good anthrobot. What can it do? And where do those patterns come from? Well, one thing it can do, if you played a bunch of, a bunch of human neurons on a dish and make a big scratch through them like this, one thing you'll find is that these, these anthrobots cluster in what we call a superbot. So they make this, this like pile up. And then what they do is over the next four days they start healing the wound. And so if you lift it up, this is what you see. They're sitting there knitting across the gap. Okay, now who would have thought that your tracheal cells, which sit there in your airway for long periods of time, dealing with dust particles and whatnot, that given the opportunity to reboot their sel, to reboot their multicellularity, would go on and make this kind of self motile thing that by the way, has the ability to heal of your body.",
