  "text": "Now if you're going to communicate, you can't just listen. You have to be able to convey messages to. And so this is just one example. I could show you hours of this kind of stuff where what we can do is say to some, some cells that are going to normally make a gut, we can give them the message that says make an eye. And that message is encoded electrically. We introduce it using ion channel potassium channels encoded by RNA that make a little voltage gradient that looks just like that eye spot that I showed you a minute ago. And sure enough, the cells get the message and they make an eye.",
