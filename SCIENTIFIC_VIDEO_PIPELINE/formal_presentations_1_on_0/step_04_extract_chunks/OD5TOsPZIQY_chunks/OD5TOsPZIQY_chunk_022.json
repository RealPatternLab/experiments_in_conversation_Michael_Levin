  "text": "Now if you're going to communicate, you can't just listen. You have to be able to convey messages to. And so this is just one example. I could show you hours of this kind of stuff where what we can do is say to some, some cells that are going to normally make a gut, we can give them the message that says make an eye. And that message is encoded electrically. We introduce it using ion channel potassium channels encoded by RNA that make a little voltage gradient that looks just like that eye spot that I showed you a minute ago. And sure enough, the cells get the message and they make an eye.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the concept of cellular communication and reprogramming through bioelectricity. He explains how cells can be instructed to change their normal development path, such as from gut cells to eye cells, using electrically encoded messages introduced via RNA-encoded potassium channels that create a specific voltage gradient.",
