  "text": "Sometimes it synapses on the spinal cord here, sometimes to the gut, sometimes nowhere at all. And these animals can see perfectly well. How do we know? Because we built a device that trains them, automatically trains them on visual cues. And we can show that they learn through visual assays. This is amazing. Why do you not need additional rounds of evolutionary adaptation? Here you've got an animal with a radically different sensory motor architecture, the eyes connected to the spinal cord or some other organ. Why does this just work out of the box? And that's because every instance of embryogenesis or regeneration or remodeling or metamorphosis is not a hardwired process driven by the chemistry of genetics. What it is is a problem solving process that takes place when an active agent interprets the information that it has, including its genetic affordances and everything else.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses an animal's ability to adapt to changes in sensory motor architecture, such as the eyes connecting to the spinal cord or another organ, without additional evolutionary adaptation. This is attributed to the problem-solving process that occurs during embryogenesis, regeneration, remodeling, or metamorphosis, which is not solely driven by genetics but also involves the active interpretation of information, including genetic affordances.",
