  "text": "But biology exploits intelligence and goal directed navigation in lots of different spaces. So the space of possible gene expressions, the space of possible physiological states, and the one we're going to talk about most is the anatomical morphospace. This, this, this thing that's essential for intelligence, this perception action loop, happens in all kinds of other spaces that are very difficult for us to recognize. This has lots of implications for things like, like AIs and, and various hybrid hybrids and organoids and things where people look at them and say, well, this is not embodied, it just sits there, it doesn't move in the physical world. Right, but the physical world is not the only world where you can do this critical perception action loop. And so what I mean by anatomical intelligence, I don't just mean complexity and I don't even just mean reliability. I mean problem solving. And so here's a very simple example of a goal directed system.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of intelligence in biology, specifically in the context of goal-directed navigation in various spaces such as gene expression, physiological states, and anatomical morphospace. The speaker emphasizes the importance of the perception-action loop in these spaces and its implications for AI and hybrid organoids. The speaker defines anatomical intelligence as problem-solving, not just complexity or reliability.",
