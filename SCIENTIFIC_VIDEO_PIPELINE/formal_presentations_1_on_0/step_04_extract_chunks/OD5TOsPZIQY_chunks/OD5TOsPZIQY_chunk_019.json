  "text": "some, some, some level of conscious experience because it fulfills all of the criteria that we normally use to acquire to attribute consciousness to each other. So what we're interested in is understanding, okay, if we're going to use the collective intelligence of morphogenesis as a model system, one of the things we'd like to do is to communicate with it. And in order to do that, the first thing we developed were some tools to basically read the information content of its mind. And so basically to read out the electrical activities the way that neuroscientists read out the states of the brain. And we developed a fluorescent dye technology that allows us. Here are a bunch of cells in dish deciding whether they should be a collective or not. Here are some cells in an early frog embryo.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of consciousness and collective intelligence in morphogenesis. They mention the development of tools to read the 'mind' of this system, akin to how neuroscientists read brain states, using fluorescent dye technology. The context includes cells deciding on collective behavior and early frog embryo development.",
