  "text": "So originally we had the counting numbers and then somebody invented zero and then negative numbers. And then eventually people figured out that even the rationals weren't the limit of things and so on. And what's important here is that each one of these expansions required a conceptual leap. It required us to break prior categories that we thought define what is essential about numbers. It actually was quite disturbing. So lots of people died, for example, when irrationals were discovered. Like this poor guy Hippasus was either killed or drowned on his own from the horror of this kind of thing. And we just need to remember that expanding these categories is not trivial, it's often painful. And the ability to recognize other kinds of things that didn't fit your previous category is in order so that you can do something useful with them. And in, in the context of what we're talking about now, which is other types of beings actually have some sort of active compassionate relationship with them is, is not easy. We as humans are really primed to recognize this kind of thing.",
