  "text": "So the blue ones are the ones that we injected. All of this other stuff, this lens that's sitting out in the, in the flank of a tadpole, we didn't touch any of those cells. These cells told those cells what to do. They said, they said, you need to participate with us to make this thing because there's not enough of us to make to. And by the way, these other cells resist. They have a different vision of the future that they were following before. And we can actually track the communication that goes back and forth and to see who wins. Because it's a cancer suppression mechanism. Cells don't just pick up whatever message you happen to give them, they resist. They have their own idea of what they should be doing.",

The speaker also mentions a cancer suppression mechanism, where cells resist external messages, maintaining their own developmental path.",
