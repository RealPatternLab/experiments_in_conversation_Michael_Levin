  "text": "So let's say there's a couple of hundred thousand cells here, and you say, well, there's an embryo. What are you actually counting when you say there's one embryo? What is there one of? Well, what there's one of is alignment. What there's one of is a story that all of the cells have bought into a self model that guides their movement in anatomical space, in the space of possible anatomical configurations. And the reason there's one embryo is because all the cells agree that is where they're going. If you were to, and I used to do this in duck embryos as a graduate student. If you take a little needle and you put some scratches in this plastoderm. Each one of these islands doesn't feel a presence of the others, and so they align among themselves. They decide they're the embryo, but they all do it. And this is how you get twins and triplets and things like this. That means that the number of individuals inside an embryonic medium is not determined. It's certainly not set by genetics. It could be anywhere from zero to probably half a dozen or more in a standard blastoderm. And so how many actual individuals or cells can emerge from that medium is not obvious. And it's a physiological outcome that shares actually a lot of both mechanistic and functional similarities with issues of individuation in the cognitive sense.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the concept of cellular alignment in embryonic development, suggesting that the cells 'agree' on their direction and thus form an embryo. The speaker also explores the idea of individuation, stating that the number of individuals within an embryonic medium is not set by genetics, but rather a physiological outcome that shares similarities with cognitive individuation.",
