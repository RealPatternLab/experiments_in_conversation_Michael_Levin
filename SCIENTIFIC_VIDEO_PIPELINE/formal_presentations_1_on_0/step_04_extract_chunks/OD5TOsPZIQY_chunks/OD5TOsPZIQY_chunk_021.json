  "text": "So here's where the eye is going to go, here's where the mouth is going to go. Here are some placard structures. So the bioelectric stores a memory of what the thing is going to build, but it's also a cognitive glue across individuals. So here you can see when we poke this one, these two find out about this in short order. And the same thing here, you poke this embryo, there's a wave that goes. Each one of these is a whole embryo. These are not cells, these are whole embryos. You can see that there's communication within and communication between individuals. They're sitting in an aqueous medium, which is how the wave can propagate. And then here are just a bunch of cells where you can see the incredibly complex electrical activity that they're able to drive. Okay, so we're able to read these things.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the role of bioelectricity in embryonic development and cellular communication. It highlights how bioelectricity stores a 'memory' of the structure to be built and facilitates communication within and between individual embryos. The speaker also mentions the propagation of signals in an aqueous medium and the complex electrical activity driven by cells.",
