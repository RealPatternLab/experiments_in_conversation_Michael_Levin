  "text": "But these kinds of, these kinds of, for example, morphogenetic systems have huge grandiose goals like building a limb. And no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have. But the collective absolutely does. And you know that because if you try to deviate it from it, you'll see, you'll see that it knows what the set point is. So there's this question, can we, can we show how connecting cells into a larger network allows them to have larger goals? How do you expand the size of the cognitive lycone? This weird way of thinking about it has therapeutic Benefits. We try to show some practical implications for all this strange stuff that we say so that other people can see why it's useful to think about it this way. Here's a human oncogene injected into a tadpole. It normally makes a tumor. You can track why. It's because oncogenes make the cells disconnect electrically from the rest of the network. When they do that, as far as they're concerned, the rest of the body is just external environment.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of morphogenetic systems and cellular networks in the context of developmental biology. It explores how cells collectively 'know' their function and structure, despite individual cells lacking this knowledge. The speaker also discusses the role of oncogenes in tumor development, specifically how they disconnect cells electrically from the rest of the network, and the potential therapeutic implications of this research.",
