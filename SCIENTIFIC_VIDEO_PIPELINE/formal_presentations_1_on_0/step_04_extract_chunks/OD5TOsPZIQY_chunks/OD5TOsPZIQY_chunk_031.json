  "text": "In other words, this thing that you're looking at here, and then here are some videos of what the pattern actually looks like when you start tweaking the formula. This is a very simple function in complex number z, so z cubed plus 7. For example, if you do something called a Hali plot, where it's a very simple algorithm for plotting the roots of this and how the roots behave of this function, you get this amazing complex pattern. Doesn't hurt that it's kind of very organic looking, which is why I use this example. But what's salient here is that there's a tiny seed. It encodes a very complex, very rich kind of structure. And if you wanted to explain why it looks like this, there are no facts of the physical world that explain it. There is nothing in the history of, of the physics of the universe that explains why this is the way it is. The explanation does not come from the physical world. You cannot tweak any of the, you know, the, the constants of, of the universe at the beginning of the Big Bang. And get a different pattern out of this. It, it is an extra thing that is, is distinct from information you get from your genetic lineage and information you get from your physical environment. Environment. And there are plenty of patterns like this and like this and like this in that space. As you, as you play with these kinds of, you play with these kinds of things.",
