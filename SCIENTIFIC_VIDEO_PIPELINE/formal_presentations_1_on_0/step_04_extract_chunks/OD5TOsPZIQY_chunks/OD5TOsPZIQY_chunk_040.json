  "text": "Some of these will have the same existential concerns as us. Some will have very different concerns. I think that because of this interoperability, all natural life is a tiny corner of this option space and pretty much every combination of evolved material, design material, software and these patterns that you can't forget about as an ingredient is some kind of, you know, there will be hybrids and cyborgs and just every possible kind of being that we are going to have to enter some sort of ethical synthesis synth biosis with. And then the last thing I'll. Whoops, the last thing I'll say is just this, that even that there's some serious humility warranted in all of this because a lot of people think that A, it's complexity that that makes all this work or that B, there's something special about the biological material and this kind of trial and error process of evolution and our work. And again, I don't have time to get into the details.",
