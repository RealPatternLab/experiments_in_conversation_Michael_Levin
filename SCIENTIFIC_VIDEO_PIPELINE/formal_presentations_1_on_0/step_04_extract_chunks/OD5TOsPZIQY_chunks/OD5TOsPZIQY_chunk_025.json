  "text": "So it's really all this morphogene is a constant battle of worldviews. It's a battle of models. And cell collectives have to decide which model of the future they're going to go with. Another thing you can do with this interface is to actually change the scale, the size of the self, in other words, the scale of the cognitive light cone or the size of the goals that it can pursue. So again, the individual cells have little tiny cognitive light cones and they remember very simple goals like hunger level or ph or things like that. And then that's what they pursue. Their, their homeostatic set points are very simple things like that.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of morphogenesis as a battle of models or worldviews, where cell collectives decide their future. It also explores the idea of changing the scale or size of the 'self', referring to the scope of goals or 'cognitive light cones' that individual cells can pursue. These cells remember and pursue simple goals, such as hunger level or pH, which are their homeostatic set points.",
