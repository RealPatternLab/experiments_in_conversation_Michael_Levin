  "text": "So it's really all this morphogene is a constant battle of worldviews. It's a battle of models. And cell collectives have to decide which model of the future they're going to go with. Another thing you can do with this interface is to actually change the scale, the size of the self, in other words, the scale of the cognitive light cone or the size of the goals that it can pursue. So again, the individual cells have little tiny cognitive light cones and they remember very simple goals like hunger level or ph or things like that. And then that's what they pursue. Their, their homeostatic set points are very simple things like that.",

  "content_summary": "The presentation discusses the concept of morphogenesis as a battle of models, where cell collectives decide on their future model. It also explores the idea of changing the scale of the self, referring to the size of the cognitive light cones or the goals that cells can pursue. The speaker mentions that individual cells have simple goals like hunger level or pH, which they pursue as their homeostatic set points.",
