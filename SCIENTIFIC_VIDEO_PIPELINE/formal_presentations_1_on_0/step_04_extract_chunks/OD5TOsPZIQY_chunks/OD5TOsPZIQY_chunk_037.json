  "text": "So, okay, so just to kind of end here, I want to say a couple of quick things. The first thing, and so this is kind of the most, the latest and the most kind of exploratory aspect of all this work is that I see all of this stuff, the xenobots that we build, the anthrobots, the chimeras, all the things that we make. I see them as exploration vehicles. I see them as enabling a systematic mapping of the relationship between the interfaces that we make, which are the physical objects. So I think all physical objects, including cells and embryos and bodies and, and robots and everything, all of these things are physical, are interfaces or pointers into a space of pattern. Mathematicians have known this for a long time. They study kind of one region of that space. And there's all kinds of truths and patterns of mathematical objects that don't come from the physical world.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the use of xenobots, anthrobots, and chimeras as exploration vehicles for mapping the relationship between physical interfaces and pattern space. He draws parallels between physical objects and mathematical objects, suggesting that all physical entities, including cells, embryos, and robots, serve as interfaces into a space of pattern.",
