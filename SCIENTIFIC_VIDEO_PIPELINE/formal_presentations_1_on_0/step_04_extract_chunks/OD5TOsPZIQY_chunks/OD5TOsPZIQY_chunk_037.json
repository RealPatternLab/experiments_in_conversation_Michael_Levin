  "text": "So, okay, so just to kind of end here, I want to say a couple of quick things. The first thing, and so this is kind of the most, the latest and the most kind of exploratory aspect of all this work is that I see all of this stuff, the xenobots that we build, the anthrobots, the chimeras, all the things that we make. I see them as exploration vehicles. I see them as enabling a systematic mapping of the relationship between the interfaces that we make, which are the physical objects. So I think all physical objects, including cells and embryos and bodies and, and robots and everything, all of these things are physical, are interfaces or pointers into a space of pattern. Mathematicians have known this for a long time. They study kind of one region of that space. And there's all kinds of truths and patterns of mathematical objects that don't come from the physical world.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker, Michael Levin, discusses the latest developments in bioelectricity and developmental biology. He views xenobots, anthrobots, and chimeras as exploration vehicles that enable a systematic mapping of the relationship between physical objects and patterns. He also draws a connection between these biological constructs and mathematical objects.",
