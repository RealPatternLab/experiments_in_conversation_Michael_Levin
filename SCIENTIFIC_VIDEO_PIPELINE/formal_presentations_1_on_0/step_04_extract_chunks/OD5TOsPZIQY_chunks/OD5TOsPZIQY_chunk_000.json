  "text": "What I'm going to talk about today is some, some efforts that, that we and others have made to try to expand what I think of as significant mind blindness that affects us because of our evolutionary history and our focus on particular kinds of minds. And I'm going to spend the mid, the middle part of the talk discussing results that we have using the collective intelligence of body cells as a model system to understand a diverse intelligence that lives in a weird space that's hard for us to imagine, and the progress that we've actually made in communicating with that intelligence.",
