  "text": "So almost half the genome is differently expressed than it is in that tissue. So when we say why do humans look the way they look and have certain properties? You say, well, it's the human genome. Yeah. The same genome can also make this. And if you do enable them to make this, and we don't edit the genome, there's no weird nanomaterials, there are no scaffolds, no synthetic biology circuits. The cells do all the work when they do this. They will pick and choose what they express from their genome. About half of them to be in a completely different kind of form and function.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the variability of genome expression within a single organism, emphasizing that cells can selectively express different parts of their genome to achieve different forms and functions. The speaker also highlights that this process does not involve genetic editing, synthetic biology circuits, or the use of nanomaterials or scaffolds.",
