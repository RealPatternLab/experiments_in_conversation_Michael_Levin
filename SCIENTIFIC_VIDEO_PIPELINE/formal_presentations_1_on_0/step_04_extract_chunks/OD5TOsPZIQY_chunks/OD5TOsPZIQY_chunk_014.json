It makes exactly the right steps from here to there so we can regain its position in that anatomical space it navigates. But this is not just about damage. It leads to that incredible plasticity leads to phenomena like this. If we make this tadpole with no primary eyes, this is a tadpole of the frog. Here's the mouth, here are the nostrils, the brain, the tail. If we make a tadpole with no primary eyes, but we put an eye on its tail, and I'll show you in a minute how we can do that. What happens is that that eye makes a single optic nerve. The optic nerve does not go to the brain.",
