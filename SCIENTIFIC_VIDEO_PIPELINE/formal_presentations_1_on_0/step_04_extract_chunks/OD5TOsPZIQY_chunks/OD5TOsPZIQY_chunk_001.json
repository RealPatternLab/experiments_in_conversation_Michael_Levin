  "text": "So it's kind of a case study for us. But I'm also going to talk about some much, much weirder things. If anybody's interested in the primary papers, the data sets, the software, everything is here. And then here's where I keep my own kind of personal thoughts about what it all means. So I want to start off by just reminding ourselves of something that happened over history is that prior to having a solid theory of electromagnetism, we had static electricity and we had lightning, and we had magnets and we had light. And we all thought those were different things, okay? We thought these were, these were completely different kinds of, kinds of phenomena. And we were also unaware that we actually were only sensitive to a tiny part of this spectrum. What a good theory of electromagnetism did for us is several things.",

  "content_summary": "Michael Levin discusses the historical understanding of electromagnetism, noting that phenomena like static electricity, lightning, magnets, and light were once thought to be separate. He emphasizes the importance of a solid theory of electromagnetism in understanding these phenomena as part of a broader spectrum, to which humans are only sensitive to a small part.",
