  "text": "So, so here's this Oscar winning performance where, where this, this little squirrel like creature sets up a little accident scene here, right? So he puts it right on the neck. He knows what his owners, he's got a very good theory of mind. He knows what the owners are looking for in terms of paying attention to him. He's going to check in a minute to see whether anybody's watching, right? So these kinds of things, it's very easy for us to understand that there's a mind here. And so on. And that's because they operate at the same spatial temporal scale. They operate within the same space as we do. They have roughly similar biological goals. And so things that are driven by brains, especially mammals, not really problematic, usually. Well, there are some weird situations.",
