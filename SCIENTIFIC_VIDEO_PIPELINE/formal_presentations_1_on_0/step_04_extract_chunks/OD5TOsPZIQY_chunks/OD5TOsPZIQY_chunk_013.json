  "text": "So you have this, this axolotl. They are incredibly regenerative. They can, they can restore most of their body parts. If it loses a limb anywhere along this axis, the cells immediately detect that they've been deviated from their target state. They will work really hard to get back there. And then the most amazing thing of all, they stop when they're done. When do they stop? They stop when a correct axolotl limb has formed. So this is an example of a very simple homeostatic process. The system has a goal. You deviated from that goal, it expends lots of energy to get there and then it stops.",

It emphasizes their ability to restore lost body parts through a homeostatic process where cells detect deviation from their target state and work towards restoring it, stopping once the correct limb has formed.",
