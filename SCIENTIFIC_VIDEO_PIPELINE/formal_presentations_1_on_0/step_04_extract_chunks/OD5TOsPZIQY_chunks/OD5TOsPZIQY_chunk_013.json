  "text": "So you have this, this axolotl. They are incredibly regenerative. They can, they can restore most of their body parts. If it loses a limb anywhere along this axis, the cells immediately detect that they've been deviated from their target state. They will work really hard to get back there. And then the most amazing thing of all, they stop when they're done. When do they stop? They stop when a correct axolotl limb has formed. So this is an example of a very simple homeostatic process. The system has a goal. You deviated from that goal, it expends lots of energy to get there and then it stops.",

  "content_summary": "The speaker discusses the remarkable regenerative capabilities of the axolotl, a type of salamander. The cells of the axolotl can detect when they have deviated from their target state, such as when a limb is lost, and will expend energy to restore the limb. This process is an example of a homeostatic process, where the system works to maintain a stable, constant condition.",
