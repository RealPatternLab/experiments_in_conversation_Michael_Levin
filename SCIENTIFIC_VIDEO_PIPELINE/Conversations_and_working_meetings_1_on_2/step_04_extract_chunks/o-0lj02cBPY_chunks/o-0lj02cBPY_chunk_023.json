  "semantic_text": "I mean, this is for me one of the biggest issues trying to treat these kids. So many of the kids I see are in residential treatment. And so you're in this big kind of group space where you've got three shifts of staff and they're reacting to these kids in different ways. And so the same behavior and the kid can elicit very different responses from the staff. And so you're creating a very unpredictable environment for these kids, which is very hard for them to make sense of or get better. And so much of the work has to do with working with the staff and saying, yes, I know the kid. You've gone over these rules five times with this kid, but I want you to do it again. And continually be constant in terms of responses and predictable and be willing to go back and back and back and back over these things. Because the kids don't have this good cause and effect learning because the consequences and behavior are often separated and state dependent for them. And so creating predictability is like a major, major deal in treating these kids. And that's one of the things it's easier to do with foster parents or adoptive parents. But even they screw up all the time and just react. I've told you 10 times to do this or whatever, but that's very important in terms of creating safety for these kids. And I think that's kind of a biodome in a way.",
