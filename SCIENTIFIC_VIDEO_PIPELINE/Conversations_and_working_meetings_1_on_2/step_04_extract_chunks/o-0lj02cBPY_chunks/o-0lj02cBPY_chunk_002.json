More neuranatomy, neurophysiology, working on, actually invertebrates, and love those creatures. Ended up with cockroaches, you know, which horrifies some people. But they're fantastic critters kinds of things. And so I've been there, really a couple of pathways I've been going down, which, you know, I see the connections. Most people don't. But one of them is looking at a particular disorder called dissociative disorders, the multiple personality disorders. But really generalizing that to a set of disorders characterized by rapid transitions in mental state. And so that bipolar orders in there, panic attacks are in there, catatonia is in there, flashbacks are in. There's a whole series of really psychiatric disorders in. In which one of the primary issues is a very rapid transition from one state of mind into another state of mind. I'm interested in what constitutes states, particularly in the process of transitioning from one state to another. I'm interested in the disorder. I'm interested in what I see as a larger set of dynamics that are applicable to other disorders and probably represent a place of clinical leverage. If we could control switching, we could switch people out of depression, we could switch people out of mania. We could block panic attacks. We could do a lot of these things much more readily. The other thing, based on that work, I transitioned a lot to children. And partly because my work with the adults told me that they had been this way since children and that it wasn't really possible to sort of retrospectively figure out how they developed into kind of what I would call an us rather than an I. That is the degree of unification in the personality. And so in that context, I saw a lot of what I felt were biological changes in these children. And I created a study Back it started officially in 1987, still goes on. It's kind of compassed three generations looking at the biological effects of very serious child abuse. Basically we chose incest, which hits at the relationship level. Typically there's a huge number of episodes. It's not simply a molestation by a stranger, but by a family member who's living there. So it's a real hit. And have been following a sample all these years and looking at them first biologically, looking at the HPG axis, HPA axis, looking at cognitive development and these in the sample, looking at a number of different things came to the conclusion that we were looking at an accelerated aging process that now with the epigenetic work on looking at epigenetic age acceleration we really nailed that. Plus now other people using. We had this prospectively, longitudinally. We could see that their cognitive. They peaked out cognitively much earlier than our control sample. They had sort of lower attainment levels. Their HPA axis went through this transition much faster. Their HPG axis was accelerated. They came into puberty about a year earlier than our match controls which is a big thing developmentally it has a lot to do. These are all girls, by the way. I'm sorry. This was a group of incestuously abused girls. And then we've seen their children and we actually also follow prospectively their mothers, got retrospective histories on their mothers and then sort of prospectively. So we had kind of three generations. And so I'm also interested in intergenerational transmission of risk because you just see it just huge that these families just have trains of abuse going back generation after generation after generation. And that's actually something I'm trying to take on with computer modeling because you can't, you know, do that experiment really if you think about it. But, but we have about 20 things that we can identify as factors for intergenerational transmission. And so using sort of agent based modeling kinds of attacks I'm interested in. In seeing what if I can figure out what are the real pivotal issues here and what are the essentially the tipping points that that lead to transmission across generations or at least increase risk for transmission across generations. It's kind of a crazy sort of problem, but I. I don't see another way to sort of approach it. So. So I have those sets of issues in. In between. I also ran a. For about 12 years ran a forensic center that evaluated children and follow and their families. But actually did the forensic evaluations involved testifying in court, dealing with all the legal issues. And I had a fairly large Scale prevention program. This was in the city of Cincinnati where I did a sort of maternal intervention aimed at helping the children. So that's kind of a sweep of the different kinds of issues for me. They're all kind of part of the same problem. But, but people can't say what do states have to do with prevention of child abuse? So, so that's a short story, I guess.",
