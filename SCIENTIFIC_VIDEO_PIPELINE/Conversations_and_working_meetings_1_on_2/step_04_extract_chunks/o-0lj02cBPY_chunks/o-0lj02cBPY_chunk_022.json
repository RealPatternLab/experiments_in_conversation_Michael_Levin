  "semantic_text": "Yeah, I think, I think, you know, going forward, it would be very helpful to just. Just ideate back and forth later about mapping all of the things you guys know about how to provide those kind of. That kind of evidence, right? Evidence of being a safe space, evidence that you have control over your environment, all that kind of stuff, and how to remap it into things that we can do for cells. Obviously cell collectives don't have the same level or the same kind of intelligence as these kids do. But I think the basic principles are there. I think we're going to have to. It's the same message that we're trying to get across. And so it would be interesting. I mean, the most obvious thing we've done, which is to put an empty biodome on and say, look, here's your confined environment where no, you know, where you have. There's more control over the chemical milieu and you're protected and all of that. Just to think about what else could happen, what else could we do? For example, here's something we could do. I don't know how you guys feel about this, the basic active inference thing, that predictable patterns are less stressful than random patterns. One could imagine within that biodome providing some kind of a predictable stimulus that's completely nonspecific. It by itself does nothing for regeneration, but it has the feature that it is predictable and reliable. Right. And we found that. Actually our recent work found that even algae like this so algae can tell the difference. They get stressed out by unpredictability and they, they don't like it, they move away. They want a predictable, you know, light source, even if it's not any more light than the random one. They just, they just like that predictability and, you know, so maybe even something like that. You know, I don't know, I'm pulling at straws here, but I agree with that.",
