Yeah, the beam is coming. Yeah, it's, you know, it's very interesting about these areas and merging the areas. Like we see. We see this kind of thing where these. These dynamic patterns battle for. For real estate in the body and. And they compete. And sometimes they merge, and sometimes they integrate and sometimes they don't. And they set up between them. And like, if we, if we. If we induce, using ion channel expression, a specific bioelectric state in a region, and that specific bioelectric state is the thing that generates eye formation. It's what triggers eye formation in our face. You can make ectopic eyes anywhere in the body. But what often happens is there's this battle between the pattern that you've induced that says to all the cells, even the ones you didn't touch, they say, they, they, it's a group effect. So, so if I, if I manipulate, you know, 30 cells, they will get hundreds of their neighbors to help build this eye. But the neighbors are resisting at the same time because there's a different pattern that says, no, we should be gut or we should be skin. And those two, those two patterns have to fight it out. And sometimes they establish a border. I'm going to be this, you're going to be that. And they settle down and that's it. And then sometimes they integrate and they make other things that are neither of those two things are sort of a combination. And sometimes one wins or the other one wins. So, for example, you often see we have these transgenic animals that light up with the early I gene Rix1. And so we can inject our thing. We see, oh, this thing's going to have eight different eyes because there are eight different spots of RIX one coming on. And it comes on and it starts making the eye and then the other cells around it as actually, I think it's part of the cancer suppression mechanism. They actually convince the cells, you don't want to do this, we're going to be skin. And they basically, in the way it's mediated by electrical synapses, by gap junctions that enable the local voltage to take over and they just acquire, let's say, a skin pattern and they go away. Or sometimes the eye is strong enough to establish, no, we're going to be an eye and here's the limits of it. And you guys can be skin outside of that, and then that's it. And you can see this and you can, you can potentiate one way or the other by manipulating the voltage, by manipulating the communication through gap junctions. And it's this like, you know, battle of, battle of, you can say personalities, but, you know, morphogenetic worldviews about what? How are we going to go into the future? Are we going to go as an eye or a skin or what are we going to do?",
