  "semantic_text": "So it is really different than what I'm thinking about. What's one of the striking features of dissociation is amnesias. And they're usually autobiographical amnestias. That is, people cannot remember parts of their personal history. And so they don't feel connected to that flow of history. That is, part of what provides continuity in a sense of self that is across time is that you reach back and you feel like you're the same person you were yesterday. Because you have a continuity of memory is not because your DNA has changed or your fingerprints have changed or Something So that amount of ability to sort of reach past memories and to some extent future aspirations, say, is state dependent. And so in different mental states. So a manic person will tell you very different things about their past and their future and the present than the same person when they're depressed. Their associations are very different, even though the history is common across them. And so one of the things you see in different states, and we're talking about a disorder that's characterized by a lot of different states. That is, when you're dealing with somebody who has multiple personality, they have half a dozen or more sort of fairly discrete states. And they're discrete, not only sort of psychologically but actually biologically. But that's not so surprising given that if you look at somebody who's the same person depressed and the same prismatic manic, they're physiologically different also. And so. And if you look at the same person having a panic attack versus a euthymic state, they're physiologically different. So states have a physiological difference. And somebody who is switching states a lot as these people switch states has sort of a lot of discrete physiological differences, but also cognitive differences, particularly in terms of ability to access past knowledge, both. And so you'll find some of them who are completely past focused. That is, they are living in the past. They have a different body image of themselves that they think they're a child or they think they're at a different age. And then you have others who think that they're at some other kind of age. So you have this kind of temporal sort of series of, I don't know, contemporary compartmentalizations in these people. And that shows up as amnesias for past experiences so that they don't remember doing things that they were witnessed doing and that sort of thing. And that is a function of the different dissociative states. We can go in and give cognitive measures and see those differences in the individual in terms of their cognitive attainment, what they can do, what information they can retrieve. We can give one personality a list of words and another personality a list of words that are very similar but different, like sofa and couch or lamp and light or something like that, and look at crossover, how much interference is there across. And some of them are very, very able to keep this information very, very separate. And whereas our control subjects, the information gets all confused and they can't pick out which list the word came from. And they can't give you words on this day versus list B. So there is this sort of state compartmentalization Cognitively, there's kind of a physiology that's pretty replicable across different states. We would measure most, most of our subjects multiple times across multiple days and see that, that not the different states or personality states were pretty coherent within themselves, but across time, across states there was a lot of difference. But there were certain places where there were connections. One more what I'd call the autonomic nervous system level. Things like habituation to startle. So if you habituated one personality, that habituation carried across the other personalities, if you're too startled. So there were certainly connectivity also. They were not separate, entirely separate. There were levels of connectivity even though their subjective experiences is very much as if they were separate people. And they're adamant about that. Had this experience of talking to a subject I saw in 1981, okay, he's now like 90 years old. And he hunted me down and wanted to talk about the study he was in with me. And one, he was remarkably consistent. You know, I'd seen him 30, 40 years ago. And as I met again his personalities, Philip Luther one called Legion, who's his angry personality, it was like, wow, they're just the same as they were 40 years ago. The other thing is he's kind of remarkable because he's still alive at 90. Most of these people don't make it past about 65 or so. They, they're, they're very much. I think, because what we're seeing with this accelerated aging is that they make it to about 60, 65, and then there's just this massive die off. That's because they're developing all these common causes of death. But at much earlier ages, this is one of the consequences of the earlier accelerated aging in them is. And you see that in epidemiological studies of people who have these histories that there's a big dropout in your population. It's around 60, 65 for that. And some of the studies show that these very serious early childhood experiences take about 20 years off your life. They really are examples of this accelerated aging and its consequences. Now we're just beginning to tap that, I think, but I'm very excited about these epigenetic tools that are coming out in terms of providing us with biomarkers to look at the effects of trauma. What we see in the very limited data we have is, and I would stress that, is that the traumatic experiences happening in childhood seem to be much more associated with subsequent accelerated aging than traumatic experiences that happened in adulthood, kinds of things. So that in that developmental period that seems to be and all the children looked at so far in childhood have this epigenetic aging acceleration effect, whereas not all the adults have that kind of thing, but the ones who have it are more likely to have had trauma in childhood.",
