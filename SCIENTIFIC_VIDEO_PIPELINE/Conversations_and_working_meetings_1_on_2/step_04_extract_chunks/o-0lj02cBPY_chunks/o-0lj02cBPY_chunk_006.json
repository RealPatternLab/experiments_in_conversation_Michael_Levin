I was thinking, Michael, to start with your hypothesis that if we take development first. Development is active. There is a morphogenic goal set up. And to me, during development, it's a very active phase. There's a lot of work to do, a lot of construction to make. And in that sense, the system is hopeful, optimistic. You know, it's hopeful to reach the goal. And you have this measure in your paper with leo, active information storage, which simply means that during development there's much data transfer from the past to the present. We use our memories quite a bit, and we use them to move toward the goal in the future. What that means is the temporal depth is significant. Your light cone is present during development.",
