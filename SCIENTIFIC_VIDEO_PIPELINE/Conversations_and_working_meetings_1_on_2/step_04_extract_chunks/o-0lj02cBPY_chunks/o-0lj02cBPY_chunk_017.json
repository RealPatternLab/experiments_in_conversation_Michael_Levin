Well, let me react to that because here's where I do see, first of all, where you do see integration is spontaneous. That is, you've broken down the barriers in some way between these different states or personalities. You know, the language there is always a little tricky and that they're better able to share information and particularly retroactive retrospective memory. And that's where the trauma comes in. Often that, that trauma is very encapsulated and so what you often are faced with a clinician is they come in and they say, you know, Tanya and Tom have joined, you know, and they're tamya or something like that. And so rather than trying to force this, which is what very happened in the field very early on, where people were using these hypnotic ceremonies and rituals, trying to fuse these things together, it's more likely to happen spontaneously. Now, that bio compartment that you're talking about, what the patients do, is they create that for themselves and that for the different personalities. If you go to their house, you'll see that house is not set up in some sort of continuous linear way for, you know, like an adult detriment. It's set up in little areas. And this is Tanya's area and Tom's area and this sort of thing. So it's very compartmentalized. And when those states come out, and they often come out in some very regular way in. In the spontaneous world, we've done things like put beepers on them and beep them at different times and said, what's going on and what personality is out? And that sort of thing. And we find that they're very different than they are in the office. What you see in your office is not necessarily what that person is living in the. In the world in terms of the frequency of the altered personalities, but they create different spaces for themselves where they can go off and be kind of by themselves. And that enlarges. And part of that integration process is that and Tom and Tanya will merge their spaces and so that they feel comfortable that way also. So you see this process going on and to some extent being acted out in their environment.",
