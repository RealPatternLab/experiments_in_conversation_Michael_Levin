Both, both that and the thing that Alexei was talking about has potentially it's direct suggestions I think, for therapeutics both on the cancer side in this case and on the regenerative side for the things that Alexei was talking about. Because the thing about the bulletin board, I mean this is a stigmargy that the cells use all the time and patterns in the body use all the time to leave messages for each other. And I wonder if the cancer therapeutics that we were using, where we do actually forcibly integrate them, whether that's too much of a sledgehammer and that listening to what you just said, maybe, maybe the limitations of that is going to be the resistance. And then instead of that, what we should be going for is to augment the stigma between them so that they can communicate but are not reduce that threat that they're going to be wiped out. I mean we, as, as, you know, as the clinician, you want to wipe it out in that case, but maybe you don't go in there with a therapeutic that is super obvious about it and maybe we got to do it slightly differently. The thing with what Alexi said about the future hope and the collapse of the future and all that, also very interesting in terms of both aging and regeneration. I think there's a lot to be said for the fact that in some organisms like us, the vast majority of our cells do not believe that they're going to be able to regenerate and they, and thus they don't. And it would be. We've. I've thought about different ways to affect that prior, you know, like, like one of the things, one of the things we found that that helps is if you. So, so for the, for the leg regeneration work, what we do is we, after amputating the limb and you put on this wearable bioreactor. So it's this thing that provides an enclosed aqueous environment for the wound. And then you can put in various payloads like ion channel drugs and things that try to induce specific morphogenetic events. But even an empty biodome helps. An empty bio dome that has nothing in it, no payload at all, is already somewhat inducive of regeneration, I think because it provides for the cells evidence that they can impact their environment. If you're out in dry air as a mammal or if you're in a giant bucket of water as a, as a, as a frog, everything you do, you do not have the ability to establish properties of your microenvironment you have no control over your microenvironment in those scenarios. But if you have a protected aqueous small volume environment, you can. So by putting autocrine signals out there, you can say, hey wait, I did increase the ph of the medium or I did increase the amount of sodium or BMP or whatever it's going to be. And so, so even that is already by giving them a little bit of control over their microenvironment. Because that's a major puzzle that everybody says, why does the empty bio dome work? That shouldn't be. I actually think that's maybe one of the key parts of this is to convince the cells that there actually is a future here, that they're not just waving out in the wind, as you know, as an animal would be in the wild, that gets their leg bitten off. You know, you're going to be trying to step on it, grinding it into the forest floor. You're not going to regenerate anything under those circumstances. It's not safe. And it's, and it's in fact foolish to put energy into trying because whatever you try to grow is not going to work. But maybe that biodome. And I've also been thinking about very, and I'm not an expert on this part, but some kind of plastogens, you know, psychedelics that try to kind of enlarge the basically, basically increase the plasticity of, and reduce the certainty of your priors, right? As a mammal, as a mammalian limb, you have very strong priors that you're never going to be able to regenerate. Your liver doesn't share those priors for some reason. But, but, but, but, but your limb, but your limbs do. And so, and deer antlers, deer antlers don't share them either, right? So bone there, you've got, you've got bone vasculature, innervation, skin. Every year you make, you know, a centimeter of new bone per day. When they're regenerating these things, I mean, it's insane.",
