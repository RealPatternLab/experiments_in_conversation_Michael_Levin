  "semantic_text": "So really an essential question. So actually what you do see is compartmentalization of certain functions. So I've had a number of extraordinary performers come through and in certain personality states, they were capable of really extraordinary kind of cognitive functions in other personality states that was not available to them kind of thing. One of them was a student at Harvard who I had completely independent verification from a professor about her. He came and asked me about her and she. In, in. She was in law school and she's also getting a degree in physiology, philosophy, and she could write with both her hands in, in her legal state. And he said it was driving the other students nuts because she was taking two streams of independent thoughts off lectures. And he said they were very competitive bunch. And the idea that this fellow student was taking two sets of notes that were different was so. So. But that was confined to a particular altered state. Now, she also had really remarkable photographic memory. I took her down to the stacks of law, the National Library of Medicine, and I would pull a book off the shelves, open it to a page. She could look at it for a minute and she could read it back verbatim. It was extraordinary. And I certainly have seen this certain altars having sort of idiot savant level kinds of functions that were very kind of narrowly associated with these different sorts of states. And then the same one woman had a. A child state called Missy And Missy was just a little tiny little child curled up in a ball and would speak in this little tiny whisper and really couldn't sort of participate in many of our studies kinds of things. So it's not as if they all necessarily add up to one single unified sense of self. There are a series of preserved abilities that are very sort of compartmentalized in them. And they, they, excuse me for they adapt to the world by developing personalities that handle functions that they can't handle in other states. And so it gets to be kind of highly refined in some of these people where there'll be one who puts gas in the car and that's the mechanic. And that's all that sort of state comes out for, is that it's triggered by the need to fill up the car. And so that's that state comes out kind of thing. So the capacity is in there somewhere, but it isn't generalizable. It's very compartmentalized. I mean, I think. And so one of the consequences for them behaviorally is they can't learn well from experience because the experience and the consequences are often quite separated. And so they, they end up being very preservative and making the same mistakes over and over and over again kinds of things. And, and they can't use what they know is. It's a kind of a metacognitive deal with that amazing.",
