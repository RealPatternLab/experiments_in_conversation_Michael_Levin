Because what you're really looking at, for example, is a hundred thousand cells. And when you say there's one embryo, what helps you, what you're really counting is alignment. And you're counting the fact that all of these individual cells are aligned towards the same vision of what they're doing. They're building a particular structure, they're going to work like hell to get there, despite various interventions. And so I wonder. And so it's kind of, I don't even think these are necessarily distinct things, but, you know, there's a way to think about this as reintegration, so that, so that now there really is one thing, but under the hood, what that might be. And again, I'm not making any claims on about psychological matters because I don't know any of this stuff. But, but, but I, but, but I wonder if under the hood, what you're really looking at is a more adaptive alignment so that the, the, the fragment that's good at particular kinds of interactions handles that business in your life and that's another fragment that handles something else. And as long as they're all, you know, once, if they're not aligned, then, then of course it's going to be a nightmare. But, but fine, then it's kind of fine that you have these specializations that can come out and do specific things. So, you know, I don't know if that, if that makes sense.",
