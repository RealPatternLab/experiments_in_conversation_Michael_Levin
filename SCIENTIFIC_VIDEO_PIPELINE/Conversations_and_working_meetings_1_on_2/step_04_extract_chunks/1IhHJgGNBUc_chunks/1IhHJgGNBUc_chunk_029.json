  "semantic_text": "Super interesting, if I may, because you brought the big elephant in the room. I think throughout your work you're saying all intelligences are collective. And I think we need to talk about it. And I look forward to Thomas, the high level paper that you think about how psychiatry would look like with Michael's principles. But I think we can talk a bit about it. Let me give you a citation. The definition of dissociation in the latest version of the DSM 5 TR is a disruption and or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, bodily representation, motor control and behavior. The integration is deemed normal in the guiding document. And then if I quote a neuroscientist, Daniel Seth, he says that monadic self is A form of a delusion in a sense that it only exists at the level of subjective belief and not an objective outside reality. Then we have your statement that all intelligences are collective. How do we reconcile these things together? What do we do? And I want to give some credit to dsm, you know, it is indeed so that, you know, on average, healthy individuals subjectively feel at the level of phenomenology, the continuity of the mind. You know, it goes back to Emmanuel Kant, 18th century, where. But I am the same as I have been before and I predict to be the same in the future. We even, you know, kind of. We bind together things, you know, we're bind together things. When I listen to you speak, you know, into coherent whole. There's a lot of integration, binding happen and a lot of disorders have to do with disintegration. But the important thing I think is the perspective. Collective intelligence is something that we see from the outside, not from the inside. The way I feel inside my body is at that level as a coherent whole. So perspective is one thing. The second thing is when we wrote in the paper that if we model self as a nested, embedded functional system, then, you know, essentially it's. It's a hierarchical system of beliefs. We. I don't like the annual sets word delusion. I think it pathologizes an important thing. I would say belief or inference. But beliefs can be powerful. They can kill. So I think that. And it's only the higher levels of the self that believe in the unity. The autobiographical self, the core self, the hunger doesn't even have an eye. It's a low blood sugar that compels me to go do something. So this is the higher levels of the. The hierarchy that have the. The unified self. And this is what we, you know, interact with in psychotherapy with a patient. And the final thing is the kind of the distance. You know, if again we have a house and we look at a person moving between different rooms, then they are different and collective, perhaps. But if I'm a mile away and I look at the person in the house, it looks as the same system. So, but, but I. I want to say that they're not. It's not necessarily a paradox. If we qualify at which level of the hierarchy and from which perspective, then we can have unity here and collective there. And we also can have it lower levels of the hierarchy, collective intelligence. Take ant colony. The intelligence of the colony is unified at the next upper level of the hierarchy. That's the definitionally emergent. Emergent property happens at the higher level. So I just wanted to bring it here to discuss.",
