But yeah, I mean, I think, I think my, my experience and a lot of people who, who do meditate, you know, there's this sort of learning curve that, that happens where you start off. All the mind is, the monkey mind is thinking about all the stuff all the time and, and you know, you kind of eventually get through that and there's a sort of a feeling of maybe some sort of more, more unification. And people use the analogy of, you know, the choppy waters at the top and you get down and it becomes more still. But actually I think a lot of people then realize that when you really get quiet enough, you actually start, you know, that's when the weird stuff starts happening, right? That's when you start hearing sort of strange little voices. Then you don't know where they come from or, or, or, or ideas that are popping into your head that feel like they've just been burped out of nowhere. And yeah, I mean, I think there's a reason that the Buddhist puts so much on the fact that there is no sort of unified self. Because I think at least the phenomenology of some of these states, which are hard won and take a long time to get into, kind of do suggest that, that really when you pay attention there's not that there's not that unity. And also, I mean dream dreams and, and, and, and things that happen to us, you know, throughout the day, I think feel less unified than maybe they, they might.",
