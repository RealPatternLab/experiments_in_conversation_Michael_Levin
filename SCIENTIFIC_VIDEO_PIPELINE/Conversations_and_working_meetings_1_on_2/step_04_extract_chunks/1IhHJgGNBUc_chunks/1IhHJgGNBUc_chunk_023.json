I think what, what you're doing there is you're telling the cell collective or tissue, for example, that, you know, I speak your language and it's okay, to talk to me. And if you use a different API, different interface and like, who are you? You're not me. I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to engage. So you find the circumstances, you create the context in which the communication that is healing becomes possible. So. Mike, you've spoken about your, your anthrobot, is that, that's what they're called, right? And, and the notion that, you know, in the future they could be used therapeutically as a sort of non immunogenic agents that, you know, you can put inside the organism and then they can do, they can do their thing. Right. And again, I keep on trying to sort of see other analogies kind of psychologically that, that, that one can do here and it gets, it gets a bit weird, right? But like, is, is there a, you know, is there something that's made out of, of the same psychic DNA as us that is much, much smaller and maybe a bit more stupid, but acting when you've got loads of them, you know, when they're in there, they, you know, they, they can do a good job. And, and which, because it's made from the same sort of stuff as you, doesn't elicit the, you know, the, that sort of rejection. Right. Like, and, and in a way, part of the therapeutic alliance that, I guess what Alexia is talking about is, is, is a smoothing over of that possibility of rejection. I mean, the number of times, the first time I meet a patient, things are pretty rough. And then over, you know, over, over the weeks and months they might smooth down. But. Yeah, and again, there's the. I guess I run the risk of kind of caricaturing things because what Alexei does is so sort of subtle and nuanced and I'm kind of coming at it with all these kind of cell analogies and the like. But, you know, it seems weird that we can think of anthrobots made of cells, but we can't think of similar things made of thoughts or other kind of stuff. At least none that we, that I can, that we can use maybe in a sort of systematically effective way.",
