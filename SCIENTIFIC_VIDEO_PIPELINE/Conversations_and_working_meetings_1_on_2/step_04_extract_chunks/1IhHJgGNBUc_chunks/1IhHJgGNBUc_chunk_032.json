  "semantic_text": "I, I agree with you both entirely. When I wake up, I notice myself in this non egoic state that Metzinger is talking about. And Thomas, you talk about where things just flow through the mind. There's not even an eye. I mean, I don't yet recall that it's Tuesday and 9 o' clock and what I'm about to do, but just little things that flow through the mind is this sort of non egoic sense of self. But I wanted to leave some space. I'm trying to say that we're not here to come in and say you guys are wrong when you talk about your unity. Because if you take the very severe patients, you take the DID disintegration causes a lot of distress. These patients suffer tremendously. And so it is of course all the spectrum. But I think that we do work with reintegration in a specific clinical practice of traumatized patients with DID DPTR are in dissociative disorders. Yes, it is a belief, yes. But that, that belief is very important to try to restore to. Because they cannot work, they cannot maintain relationships with their loved ones and they drink too much or you know, use substances. And part of it is the disruption, the, the lack of continuity, predictability. We'll go back developmentally. You know, we take children. A lot of things that happen in children's lives can be metabolized and they can. But, but when they have lack of predictability, lack of continuity, this is an issue. So even divorce, the world changes. So I just want to say that in sort of more severe kinds of pathology there is space for this belief or not. I'm not saying it's hardware, it's not hardware, but at the level of software, it's important that Microsoft Word is the same Microsoft Word, isn't it? Right.",
