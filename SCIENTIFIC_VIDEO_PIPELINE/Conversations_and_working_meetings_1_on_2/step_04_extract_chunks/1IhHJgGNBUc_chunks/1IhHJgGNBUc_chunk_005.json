Sometimes it's a hard question to answer, and we need repeated neuropsych evaluations a year apart, and imaging data to investigate whether there is or there isn't dementia. But if we take it a step further into the progression of this condition, then one of the viewpoints is that what we see is disintegration. Proponents of the global workspace theory saying that you have this unity of consciousness as the sign of health. And I just wanted to bring it up because we talk a lot about Michael's viewpoint that all intelligences are collective. And I wanted to mention a couple of things in the DSM where it bumps very strongly into a prevalent fuse. But in dementia specifically, you start seeing fragments, you know, this sort of islands. And perhaps I'm quoting Lionel Nakash, a neurologist, and other colleagues, but to me, this is also an interesting viewpoint. If we just take one aspect of this conversation of integration and disintegration at different levels from different perspectives in health and pathology, I think that may be useful, maybe starting point.",
