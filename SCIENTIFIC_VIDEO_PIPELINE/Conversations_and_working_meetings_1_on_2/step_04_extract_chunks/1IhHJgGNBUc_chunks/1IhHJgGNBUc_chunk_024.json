And one of the, you know, there are sort of more conventional practical uses of these, of these anthrobots is just, you know, they're delivering some sort of specific reparative intervention, whatever. But I think the bigger picture might be that they're actually just vehicles for transplanting behavior patterns or memories. And that's something that people have done. You know, transplantation of memories is a thing that people have done in various animal, animal models and we've done it too in morphogenesis. And one of the wild things about it is that oftentimes it's a very small piece of tissue that you transplant and it somehow takes over the whole thing. So in cases where we've done transplants of pieces of tissue from two headed worms into one headed worms or pieces of tissue into tadpoles that otherwise would have had some sort of severe brain defect. And in many of these cases you get, you get conversion to the new pattern, right? Either normalization or you get the two heads carried over. And it's like why I only introduced a few cells. Why don't they get taken over by the, you know, convinced by the rest of the environment to do that? It's very non linear. You can't really tell. You know, it's not the size of the tissue that matters, it's the, you know, maybe it's something like, you know, how compelling is your message, right? Like the signaling that you're doing. How likely is it to, to actually get alignment of the bigger system that, that you're in something like that. And we see, we see this, this, this kind of battle of like it's funny, if you, if you, if you. In, in an early frog embryo, if you inject some, some cells with a particular potassium channel rna, it makes a voltage that is, is really equivalent to the, the voltage spot that sets up I formation. And so now what you have is a few cells that are saying to their neighbors, let's make an eye. And, and they, and, and this is very much a, a message that goes outwards because there's not enough of them to do it themselves. And so in the cases where you do get an eye, you can section it, you can see that there's actually only very few cells that you injected. What they did was convince all their neighbors to participate. And their name, you know, it was kind of a secondary induction effect. You didn't touch the neighbors. They, they convince them. But, but what typ. But, but what typically happens is there's an interesting battle that goes on because those cells are signaling to their neighbors and let's make an eye. Their neighbors meanwhile are doing their normal tumor suppression thing and they're saying no, your voltage is crazy. You should be skin. And so you should be this, this instead. And, and they, and they fight and, and try to convince each other. And so, and in some cases you get the iron, in some cases you get nothing because, because the skin one and, or the gut cells one and said, this is, you know, you're wrong. And, and, and it actually goes that way. And that's, and that's a way, that's a, that's a very basic thing that, that bodies do to suppress carcinogenic transformations like all, you know, all the time. So, so I think it's quite interesting how you can have these, these things as basically carriers or vehicles of information. And what's really critical is whether that, that story that you're passing on is going to take hold and become convincing and cause alignment within the larger, you know, within the larger system and in particular with behavior. So that's all on the morphology side, on the behavior side. I have been thinking about ways to like these anthrobots. We get them from donated patient tracheal epithelia. And you get this sheet, you get a sheet of information on the patient. And so one of the things that I've been wanting to do is get some from smokers and find out if my anthrobots are now nicotine addicted. Right. Do the anthrobots that come from those cells actually pursue nicotine? And if I were to take those anthropods and stick them into, I don't know, an immunosuppressed mouse or something, would the mouse inherit some of the. Right. Can you, can you actually pass behavioral propensities that way? Wow.",
