I don't know whether the example I was giving is quite getting at what you were sort of thinking of. I know you've spoken about these, the way that obsessions can build a niche and, and I suspect that there's a similar thing going on in, in that example. But is that kind of the. The what you were getting at? Yeah. So there's two things, both of which I would love to hear you guys talk about. One is what I think you were saying, the dynamics that takes place mostly at the psychological level, which is that you've had a thought and that leads you to a train of other thoughts which become maybe maladaptive, but also difficult to leave. Right. And so you Know, some I've seen, I don't know, maybe you guys have too. But some very high IQ individuals can get trapped into the stuff where they encounter some sort of, you know, they have some sort of existential crisis or something. And it, it's really quite debilitating where it wouldn't be for other people who just aren't that deep thinkers, you know, they just don't even go that far. But, but, but some people become trapped in this whirlwind of non big, you know, or, or they hear these, you know, human. I've actually seen it with, you know, what happened when I was, when I was doing philosophy, homeschooling my kid. I realized real quick that you got to be very careful with these things because they sometimes hear these ideas, you know, from, from, from human and girl and whatever and like, oh no. And you know, if you're, if it really just like screws up your, you know, your whole thing and climbing out of that can be hard. So, so that's, so that's one thing. But, but, but the other thing I'm also really interested in is the, is the niche construction. So, so once you've had certain kinds of thoughts and they start, they start sort of auto catalyzing themselves, do they in fact, and, and how much do they affect the underlying substrate? So do they actually induce measurable changes in the, in the neural, you know, I don't know what, whatever metric you would use, but do they actually make those kind of organic changes which then of course will facilitate their own, their own construction? I'm interested in that from the perspective of some of our work on thoughts as thinkers. So this idea that it's the patterns actually that can be, Well, I mean we're patterns too, but it's the patterns that can be the agents. And trying to look at some of these things from the perspective of thought patterns and memories that maybe have a drive to either persist or to change their environment or to. I don't know what they're actually driven to, but these are the kinds of things I've been thinking about.",
