But they're fantastic critters kinds of things. And so I've been there, really a couple of pathways I've been going down, which, you know, I see the connections. Most people don't. But one of them is looking at a particular disorder called dissociative disorders, the multiple personality disorders. But really generalizing that to a set of disorders characterized by rapid transitions in mental state. And so that bipolar orders in there, panic attacks are in there, catatonia is in there, flashbacks are in. There's a whole series of really psychiatric disorders in. In which one of the primary issues is a very rapid transition from one state of mind into another state of mind. I'm interested in what constitutes states, particularly in the process of transitioning from one state to another. I'm interested in the disorder. I'm interested in what I see as a larger set of dynamics that are applicable to other disorders and probably represent a place of clinical leverage. If we could control switching, we could switch people out of depression, we could switch people out of mania. We could block panic attacks. We could do a lot of these things much more readily. The other thing, based on that work, I transitioned a lot to children. And partly because my work with the adults told me that they had been this way since children and that it wasn't really possible to sort of retrospectively figure out how they developed into kind of what I would call an us rather than an I. That is the degree of unification in the personality. And so in that context, I saw a lot of what I felt were biological changes in these children. And I created a study Back it started officially in 1987, still goes on. It's kind of compassed three generations looking at the biological effects of very serious child abuse. Basically we chose incest, which hits at the relationship level. Typically there's a huge number of episodes. It's not simply a molestation by a stranger, but by a family member who's living there. So it's a real hit. And have been following a sample all these years and looking at them first biologically, looking at the HPG axis, HPA axis, looking at cognitive development and these in the sample, looking at a number of different things came to the conclusion that we were looking at an accelerated aging process that now with the epigenetic work on looking at epigenetic age acceleration we really nailed that. Plus now other people using. We had this prospectively, longitudinally. We could see that their cognitive. They peaked out cognitively much earlier than our control sample. They had sort of lower attainment levels. Their HPA axis went through this transition much faster. Their HPG axis was accelerated. They came into puberty about a year earlier than our match controls which is a big thing developmentally it has a lot to do. These are all girls, by the way. I'm sorry. This was a group of incestuously abused girls. And then we've seen their children and we actually also follow prospectively their mothers, got retrospective histories on their mothers and then sort of prospectively. So we had kind of three generations. And so I'm also interested in intergenerational transmission of risk because you just see it just huge that these families just have trains of abuse going back generation after generation after generation. And that's actually something I'm trying to take on with computer modeling because you can't, you know, do that experiment really if you think about it. But, but we have about 20 things that we can identify as factors for intergenerational transmission. And so using sort of agent based modeling kinds of attacks I'm interested in. In seeing what if I can figure out what are the real pivotal issues here and what are the essentially the tipping points that that lead to transmission across generations or at least increase risk for transmission across generations. It's kind of a crazy sort of problem, but I. I don't see another way to sort of approach it. So. So I have those sets of issues in. In between. I also ran a.

This was in the city of Cincinnati where I did a sort of maternal intervention aimed at helping the children. So that's kind of a sweep of the different kinds of issues for me.

    "semantic_text": "Fascinating. Fascinating. Yeah. Many things to, to talk about and I'll, I'll tell you kind of the big picture of what we do, but I just wanted to, because you brought it up, I wanted to say one, one interesting thing that is brand new out of our lab that you may not have seen yet regarding to aging, to what you said about aging. So it turns out that in normal human patients, if there is such a thing, if you look at the gene expression that they have young versus older, one of the things that we find during aging is a dissociation of the phylogenetic age of the genes that they are expressing. And what I mean by that is younger tissues, all of the different organs are in pretty tight agreement about where on the tree of life most of your genes should be. So there's, there's this technique called phylo stratigraphy which tells you for, for any given gene, you know roughly how old, how old it is right across the tree, like so, so if you look at, if you look at young, young tissues, all of the tissues in the body are basically concordant with respect to the age of the genes that they're expressing. During age, the different organs start to float away from each other. They start to dissociate and they start to express differently across the tree of life, including some of them go, go backwards, right? Traverse the evolutionary history backwards towards more primitive genes. But what you find, which I think is to me quite interesting with respect to what you study is the loss of concordance. They are no longer in agreement. There's not just one story about where we are on the tree of life, but there are multiple stories. And, and, and you know how much of the aging phenotype is actually a consequence of the fact that you are now, I don't know if they're switching. It's, you know, we don't know that. But, but what we do know is that you now have different regions in the body that are no longer in agreement about where, where what the age of their genes should be. And I think in that wild, so, so we study, I mean for years we've been studying the spatial dissociation of cancer. So Cancer, in many ways is a, is a disease spatial dissociative. I mean, I call it a somatic dissociative disorder because, because what's, what happens literally is that cells disconnect from the electrical network that keeps all of the cells focused on building and maintaining specific things. So they have this, this large scale pattern memory, whether it be a heart or, you know, liver or whatever, they're working on individual cells disconnect from that, and they can no longer remember that goal. And now they're just amoebas in the environment and they do what they single celled organisms do. And we've developed a kind of integration approach where we don't kill the cells, we don't fix the genetic mutations if they have them. What we do is we reconnect them to the, forcibly reconnect them to the electrical network and they rejoin and they start doing normal things and behaving normally and, you know, and they stop making tumors and that kind of thing. But whereas cancer is that kind of dissociation in space, it now starts to look like aging, like human aging is a dissociation in time, specifically in evolutionary time. And so I think this, this issue of, I mean, you know, I think this is why Alexei brought us together. This issue of dissociation and reassociation and switching is, has profound consequences across scales. You know, not just cognitively, but, but, but somatically and biomedically as well.",

        "text": "Fascinating. Fascinating. Yeah. Many things to, to talk about and I'll, I'll tell you kind of the big picture of what we do, but I just wanted to, because you brought it up, I wanted to say one, one interesting thing that is brand new out of our lab that you may not have seen yet regarding to aging, to what you said about aging. So it turns out that in normal human patients, if there is such a thing, if you look at the gene expression that they have young versus older, one of the things that we find during aging is a dissociation of the phylogenetic age of the genes that they are expressing. And what I mean by that is younger tissues, all of the different organs are in pretty tight agreement about where on the tree of life most of your genes should be. So there's, there's this technique called phylo stratigraphy which tells you for, for any given gene, you know roughly how old, how old it is right across the tree, like so, so if you look at, if you look at young, young tissues, all of the tissues in the body are basically concordant with respect to the age of the genes that they're expressing. During age, the different organs start to float away from each other. They start to dissociate and they start to express differently across the tree of life, including some of them go, go backwards, right? Traverse the evolutionary history backwards towards more primitive genes. But what you find, which I think is to me quite interesting with respect to what you study is the loss of concordance. They are no longer in agreement. There's not just one story about where we are on the tree of life, but there are multiple stories. And, and, and you know how much of the aging phenotype is actually a consequence of the fact that you are now, I don't know if they're switching. It's, you know, we don't know that. But, but what we do know is that you now have different regions in the body that are no longer in agreement about where, where what the age of their genes should be. And I think in that wild, so, so we study, I mean for years we've been studying the spatial dissociation of cancer. So Cancer, in many ways is a, is a disease spatial dissociative. I mean, I call it a somatic dissociative disorder because, because what's, what happens literally is that cells disconnect from the electrical network that keeps all of the cells focused on building and maintaining specific things. So they have this, this large scale pattern memory, whether it be a heart or, you know, liver or whatever, they're working on individual cells disconnect from that, and they can no longer remember that goal. And now they're just amoebas in the environment and they do what they single celled organisms do. And we've developed a kind of integration approach where we don't kill the cells, we don't fix the genetic mutations if they have them. What we do is we reconnect them to the, forcibly reconnect them to the electrical network and they rejoin and they start doing normal things and behaving normally and, you know, and they stop making tumors and that kind of thing. But whereas cancer is that kind of dissociation in space, it now starts to look like aging, like human aging is a dissociation in time, specifically in evolutionary time.

Meaning I am the same as I have been and I predict to be the same Alexei, in the future now, when that collapse and I live in the here and now of the few seconds or a few minutes or whatever, and there's no temporal depth that then essentially there is no continuity of self. It's discontinuous. So the only thing we're saying is that that temporal depth is a prerequisite for coherence of the self. Is one of the arguments in the paper that without it, it's pretty impossible to maintain the coherence, if it makes any sense.",

That is, people cannot remember parts of their personal history. And so they don't feel connected to that flow of history. That is, part of what provides continuity in a sense of self that is across time is that you reach back and you feel like you're the same person you were yesterday. Because you have a continuity of memory is not because your DNA has changed or your fingerprints have changed or Something So that amount of ability to sort of reach past memories and to some extent future aspirations, say, is state dependent. And so in different mental states. So a manic person will tell you very different things about their past and their future and the present than the same person when they're depressed. Their associations are very different, even though the history is common across them. And so one of the things you see in different states, and we're talking about a disorder that's characterized by a lot of different states. That is, when you're dealing with somebody who has multiple personality, they have half a dozen or more sort of fairly discrete states. And they're discrete, not only sort of psychologically but actually biologically. But that's not so surprising given that if you look at somebody who's the same person depressed and the same prismatic manic, they're physiologically different also. And so. And if you look at the same person having a panic attack versus a euthymic state, they're physiologically different. So states have a physiological difference. And somebody who is switching states a lot as these people switch states has sort of a lot of discrete physiological differences, but also cognitive differences, particularly in terms of ability to access past knowledge, both. And so you'll find some of them who are completely past focused. That is, they are living in the past. They have a different body image of themselves that they think they're a child or they think they're at a different age. And then you have others who think that they're at some other kind of age. So you have this kind of temporal sort of series of, I don't know, contemporary compartmentalizations in these people. And that shows up as amnesias for past experiences so that they don't remember doing things that they were witnessed doing and that sort of thing. And that is a function of the different dissociative states. We can go in and give cognitive measures and see those differences in the individual in terms of their cognitive attainment, what they can do, what information they can retrieve. We can give one personality a list of words and another personality a list of words that are very similar but different, like sofa and couch or lamp and light or something like that, and look at crossover, how much interference is there across. And some of them are very, very able to keep this information very, very separate. And whereas our control subjects, the information gets all confused and they can't pick out which list the word came from. And they can't give you words on this day versus list B. So there is this sort of state compartmentalization Cognitively, there's kind of a physiology that's pretty replicable across different states. We would measure most, most of our subjects multiple times across multiple days and see that, that not the different states or personality states were pretty coherent within themselves, but across time, across states there was a lot of difference. But there were certain places where there were connections. One more what I'd call the autonomic nervous system level. Things like habituation to startle. So if you habituated one personality, that habituation carried across the other personalities, if you're too startled. So there were certainly connectivity also. They were not separate, entirely separate. There were levels of connectivity even though their subjective experiences is very much as if they were separate people. And they're adamant about that. Had this experience of talking to a subject I saw in 1981, okay, he's now like 90 years old. And he hunted me down and wanted to talk about the study he was in with me. And one, he was remarkably consistent. You know, I'd seen him 30, 40 years ago. And as I met again his personalities, Philip Luther one called Legion, who's his angry personality, it was like, wow, they're just the same as they were 40 years ago. The other thing is he's kind of remarkable because he's still alive at 90. Most of these people don't make it past about 65 or so. They, they're, they're very much. I think, because what we're seeing with this accelerated aging is that they make it to about 60, 65, and then there's just this massive die off. That's because they're developing all these common causes of death. But at much earlier ages, this is one of the consequences of the earlier accelerated aging in them is. And you see that in epidemiological studies of people who have these histories that there's a big dropout in your population. It's around 60, 65 for that. And some of the studies show that these very serious early childhood experiences take about 20 years off your life. They really are examples of this accelerated aging and its consequences. Now we're just beginning to tap that, I think, but I'm very excited about these epigenetic tools that are coming out in terms of providing us with biomarkers to look at the effects of trauma. What we see in the very limited data we have is, and I would stress that, is that the traumatic experiences happening in childhood seem to be much more associated with subsequent accelerated aging than traumatic experiences that happened in adulthood, kinds of things. So that in that developmental period that seems to be and all the children looked at so far in childhood have this epigenetic aging acceleration effect, whereas not all the adults have that kind of thing, but the ones who have it are more likely to have had trauma in childhood.",

And that's all that sort of state comes out for, is that it's triggered by the need to fill up the car. And so that's that state comes out kind of thing. So the capacity is in there somewhere, but it isn't generalizable. It's very compartmentalized. I mean, I think. And so one of the consequences for them behaviorally is they can't learn well from experience because the experience and the consequences are often quite separated. And so they, they end up being very preservative and making the same mistakes over and over and over again kinds of things. And, and they can't use what they know is. It's a kind of a metacognitive deal with that amazing.",

Both, both that and the thing that Alexei was talking about has potentially it's direct suggestions I think, for therapeutics both on the cancer side in this case and on the regenerative side for the things that Alexei was talking about. Because the thing about the bulletin board, I mean this is a stigmargy that the cells use all the time and patterns in the body use all the time to leave messages for each other. And I wonder if the cancer therapeutics that we were using, where we do actually forcibly integrate them, whether that's too much of a sledgehammer and that listening to what you just said, maybe, maybe the limitations of that is going to be the resistance. And then instead of that, what we should be going for is to augment the stigma between them so that they can communicate but are not reduce that threat that they're going to be wiped out. I mean we, as, as, you know, as the clinician, you want to wipe it out in that case, but maybe you don't go in there with a therapeutic that is super obvious about it and maybe we got to do it slightly differently. The thing with what Alexi said about the future hope and the collapse of the future and all that, also very interesting in terms of both aging and regeneration. I think there's a lot to be said for the fact that in some organisms like us, the vast majority of our cells do not believe that they're going to be able to regenerate and they, and thus they don't. And it would be. We've. I've thought about different ways to affect that prior, you know, like, like one of the things, one of the things we found that that helps is if you. So, so for the, for the leg regeneration work, what we do is we, after amputating the limb and you put on this wearable bioreactor. So it's this thing that provides an enclosed aqueous environment for the wound. And then you can put in various payloads like ion channel drugs and things that try to induce specific morphogenetic events. But even an empty biodome helps. An empty bio dome that has nothing in it, no payload at all, is already somewhat inducive of regeneration, I think because it provides for the cells evidence that they can impact their environment. If you're out in dry air as a mammal or if you're in a giant bucket of water as a, as a, as a frog, everything you do, you do not have the ability to establish properties of your microenvironment you have no control over your microenvironment in those scenarios. But if you have a protected aqueous small volume environment, you can. So by putting autocrine signals out there, you can say, hey wait, I did increase the ph of the medium or I did increase the amount of sodium or BMP or whatever it's going to be. And so, so even that is already by giving them a little bit of control over their microenvironment. Because that's a major puzzle that everybody says, why does the empty bio dome work? That shouldn't be. I actually think that's maybe one of the key parts of this is to convince the cells that there actually is a future here, that they're not just waving out in the wind, as you know, as an animal would be in the wild, that gets their leg bitten off. You know, you're going to be trying to step on it, grinding it into the forest floor. You're not going to regenerate anything under those circumstances. It's not safe. And it's, and it's in fact foolish to put energy into trying because whatever you try to grow is not going to work. But maybe that biodome. And I've also been thinking about very, and I'm not an expert on this part, but some kind of plastogens, you know, psychedelics that try to kind of enlarge the basically, basically increase the plasticity of, and reduce the certainty of your priors, right? As a mammal, as a mammalian limb, you have very strong priors that you're never going to be able to regenerate. Your liver doesn't share those priors for some reason. But, but, but, but, but your limb, but your limbs do. And so, and deer antlers, deer antlers don't share them either, right? So bone there, you've got, you've got bone vasculature, innervation, skin. Every year you make, you know, a centimeter of new bone per day. When they're regenerating these things, I mean, it's insane.",

If you can establish they feel safe, then you can deal with a lot of other issues. Yeah. And I think that the thing that I would stress in a way about the trauma here, I'm very much struck by the data that we and others have about attachment and particular form of attachment called type D attachment, which is very disruptive. People call it disorder. Dissociative attachment is highly correlated with later developing high levels of dissociation, pathological levels usually of dissociation. There are two or three longitudinal studies that have started out classifying infants and then ended up looking at adults. Those basically all found that infants and toddlers classified as highly type D attachment end up with. As adults with the higher levels of dissociation. So the question and what we know is that the parenting practices there are harsh, abusive kinds of. And you see some studies, as much as 80% of really maltreated children will have a type D attachment or attachment disturbance. They're very different clearly from the ABC type classifications that came before. So how does that trauma impact these kids? Well, I think part a lot of it has to do with safety and creating a safe sense and kind of going internalizing someplace I can go where I feel safe. But it also has to do with the fact that the parents aren't teaching the generalization of information across states. I think parents very much good parenting very much involves helping the child understand that a lot of principals cross your different states. And so, and. But all. And also having to address the idea that certain states are appropriate in certain situations and not appropriate in others. So you have one state in sort of a religious situation and another state when you're in a football state to you, and that these are different ways of being and sort of different senses of self that go along with it and identification with different sort of processes, whether it's your religion or it's your favorite team kind of thing. And once, when is it appropriate to be going, you know, go this, go that versus, you know. And what we see is that that's not going on with these kids. So they're kind of left on their own to develop their sort of set of states. And nobody's attempting to integrate across those states to say, remember what we learned here, where you can apply that there, this is part of that cause and effect, you know. And so I think there they. There's a tendency, I think in general for kids to play a lot with personality. You think about doll play or super figure play or dress up or pretend play. It has a lot to do with identity and personality and role kinds of things. And so you can be a cowboy or you can be a astronaut or you can be rock star or whatever, but you develop kind of these sorts of states. And so I think that's a normal process that gets recruited by these kids under these circumstances to help them cope with this. And so they don't have stable senses of self that generalized very well.",

        "text": "And I think that the thing that I would stress in a way about the trauma here, I'm very much struck by the data that we and others have about attachment and particular form of attachment called type D attachment, which is very disruptive. People call it disorder. Dissociative attachment is highly correlated with later developing high levels of dissociation, pathological levels usually of dissociation. There are two or three longitudinal studies that have started out classifying infants and then ended up looking at adults. Those basically all found that infants and toddlers classified as highly type D attachment end up with. As adults with the higher levels of dissociation. So the question and what we know is that the parenting practices there are harsh, abusive kinds of. And you see some studies, as much as 80% of really maltreated children will have a type D attachment or attachment disturbance. They're very different clearly from the ABC type classifications that came before. So how does that trauma impact these kids? Well, I think part a lot of it has to do with safety and creating a safe sense and kind of going internalizing someplace I can go where I feel safe. But it also has to do with the fact that the parents aren't teaching the generalization of information across states. I think parents very much good parenting very much involves helping the child understand that a lot of principals cross your different states. And so, and. But all. And also having to address the idea that certain states are appropriate in certain situations and not appropriate in others. So you have one state in sort of a religious situation and another state when you're in a football state to you, and that these are different ways of being and sort of different senses of self that go along with it and identification with different sort of processes, whether it's your religion or it's your favorite team kind of thing. And once, when is it appropriate to be going, you know, go this, go that versus, you know. And what we see is that that's not going on with these kids. So they're kind of left on their own to develop their sort of set of states. And nobody's attempting to integrate across those states to say, remember what we learned here, where you can apply that there, this is part of that cause and effect, you know. And so I think there they. There's a tendency, I think in general for kids to play a lot with personality. You think about doll play or super figure play or dress up or pretend play. It has a lot to do with identity and personality and role kinds of things. And so you can be a cowboy or you can be a astronaut or you can be rock star or whatever, but you develop kind of these sorts of states. And so I think that's a normal process that gets recruited by these kids under these circumstances to help them cope with this. And so they don't have stable senses of self that generalized very well.",
