Clinically, I guess as a neuropsychiatrist, I'm seeing patients with kind of you'd call neurological disorders, brain disorders who also present psychiatrically. Obviously those categories are a little bit problematic at some level. And a lot of the patients that I see are patients who have sort of brain inflammation and kind of immune problems with the brain. And it's interesting to see how they sort of what happens to them. But I guess the other area, the other patient group that I think would be super interesting if we had time of these patients who. They have a diagnosis called functional neurological disorder. And so these are patients who have symptoms that look very much like the symptoms that we see in neurology and neurosurgery, but there's no structural, organic cause that we can find. And there is this idea that there's a sort of a top down kind of etiology happening. And I think it touches on some of the nice ideas about sort of dissociation and placebo that I know you've written about. Yeah, yeah, super interesting.

I know you've spoken about these, the way that obsessions can build a niche and, and I suspect that there's a similar thing going on in, in that example. But is that kind of the. The what you were getting at? Yeah. So there's two things, both of which I would love to hear you guys talk about. One is what I think you were saying, the dynamics that takes place mostly at the psychological level, which is that you've had a thought and that leads you to a train of other thoughts which become maybe maladaptive, but also difficult to leave. Right. And so you Know, some I've seen, I don't know, maybe you guys have too. But some very high IQ individuals can get trapped into the stuff where they encounter some sort of, you know, they have some sort of existential crisis or something. And it, it's really quite debilitating where it wouldn't be for other people who just aren't that deep thinkers, you know, they just don't even go that far. But, but, but some people become trapped in this whirlwind of non big, you know, or, or they hear these, you know, human. I've actually seen it with, you know, what happened when I was, when I was doing philosophy, homeschooling my kid. I realized real quick that you got to be very careful with these things because they sometimes hear these ideas, you know, from, from, from human and girl and whatever and like, oh no. And you know, if you're, if it really just like screws up your, you know, your whole thing and climbing out of that can be hard. So, so that's, so that's one thing. But, but, but the other thing I'm also really interested in is the, is the niche construction. So, so once you've had certain kinds of thoughts and they start, they start sort of auto catalyzing themselves, do they in fact, and, and how much do they affect the underlying substrate? So do they actually induce measurable changes in the, in the neural, you know, I don't know what, whatever metric you would use, but do they actually make those kind of organic changes which then of course will facilitate their own, their own construction?

      "question": "Yeah, absolutely. I. I mean, I just. Maybe, Mike, this idea of the thought that breaks the thinker. I don't know whether the example I was giving is quite getting at what you were sort of thinking of. I know you've spoken about these, the way that obsessions can build a niche and, and I suspect that there's a similar thing going on in, in that example. But is that kind of the. The what you were getting at?",
      "answer": "Yeah. So there's two things, both of which I would love to hear you guys talk about. One is what I think you were saying, the dynamics that takes place mostly at the psychological level, which is that you've had a thought and that leads you to a train of other thoughts which become maybe maladaptive, but also difficult to leave. Right. And so you Know, some I've seen, I don't know, maybe you guys have too. But some very high IQ individuals can get trapped into the stuff where they encounter some sort of, you know, they have some sort of existential crisis or something. And it, it's really quite debilitating where it wouldn't be for other people who just aren't that deep thinkers, you know, they just don't even go that far. But, but, but some people become trapped in this whirlwind of non big, you know, or, or they hear these, you know, human. I've actually seen it with, you know, what happened when I was, when I was doing philosophy, homeschooling my kid. I realized real quick that you got to be very careful with these things because they sometimes hear these ideas, you know, from, from, from human and girl and whatever and like, oh no. And you know, if you're, if it really just like screws up your, you know, your whole thing and climbing out of that can be hard. So, so that's, so that's one thing. But, but, but the other thing I'm also really interested in is the, is the niche construction. So, so once you've had certain kinds of thoughts and they start, they start sort of auto catalyzing themselves, do they in fact, and, and how much do they affect the underlying substrate? So do they actually induce measurable changes in the, in the neural, you know, I don't know what, whatever metric you would use, but do they actually make those kind of organic changes which then of course will facilitate their own, their own construction? I'm interested in that from the perspective of some of our work on thoughts as thinkers.

And of course, they've been two big randomized control trials, but they're already thinking about sort of taking it into OCD and eating disorders. There's been a small study already where you're the kind of. The eating disorder voice gets kind of externalized as this kind of avatar. But I think what's so interesting there is. It's essentially. It's an act of imagination, right? It's not like I, I feel like there's. There's something so creative that you're kind of. You're giving birth to this pseudo agent, and yet if you act with it like it's a real agent, then it, it kind of does the job anyway. And there's something that really I find very sort of fascinating. Fascinating but confusing that just acting as if seems to be enough in some cases for the. For the sort of therapeutic efficacy to get there. And I don't know whether or how that happens. Amazing. That makes me think of two things. One is there are these ancient traditions where thought forms are a thing. And not only that, but you can bind the thought forms to specific objects. Now, back in the day, they didn't have AI avatars and things like that, so these would be much more passive objects or things that. Dolls and things like this. Right. So there is that whole. And, and, and the other thing that this, this reminds me of is, you know, the, the therapy for phantom limb syndrome. Have you seen this stuff? Right. So, so, so similar, right. You're providing an avatar for the, for the limb that isn't there. You're basically unclenching through the mirror, you know, from. By mirroring the other hand, you can Sort of unclench the one that's missing and that, that then eventually becomes the, the, you know, the new, the new reality. So I think, I think, I think that's extremely interesting offloading. That's a new and very useful use for AI as a kind of, you know, all VR and all these avatars and things as a way to improve our dialogue with systems. I mean, it matches nicely our attempted use of AI now as a translator tool to other intelligences that you wouldn't be able to see. So we're working on, you know, communicating with your organs and with cells and things like that. That would make it much harder. Normally it's pretty hard to do, but, but these, these kind of technologies are good for that.",

There's been a small study already where you're the kind of. The eating disorder voice gets kind of externalized as this kind of avatar. But I think what's so interesting there is. It's essentially. It's an act of imagination, right? It's not like I, I feel like there's. There's something so creative that you're kind of. You're giving birth to this pseudo agent, and yet if you act with it like it's a real agent, then it, it kind of does the job anyway. And there's something that really I find very sort of fascinating. Fascinating but confusing that just acting as if seems to be enough in some cases for the. For the sort of therapeutic efficacy to get there. And I don't know whether or how that happens.",

And, and, and the other thing that this, this reminds me of is, you know, the, the therapy for phantom limb syndrome. Have you seen this stuff? Right. So, so, so similar, right. You're providing an avatar for the, for the limb that isn't there. You're basically unclenching through the mirror, you know, from.

So I think, I think, I think that's extremely interesting offloading. That's a new and very useful use for AI as a kind of, you know, all VR and all these avatars and things as a way to improve our dialogue with systems.

I think probably in psychological therapies there might be a little bit more of that, but I imagine probably not too much either. No, they are seen really as symptoms of. Of an illness. And, And. And my feeling is that, you know, if one day someone's voice is no longer heard as the devil and it's now heard as God and it's saying. And they're saying good things, that's probably interpreted by most people in the profession as, you know, a migraine that suddenly got a bit. A bit more pleasant. You know, it's. It's just a symptom changing. And I. I don't think that's the right way to. To think about it. But I suppose from the clinical perspective, as soon as the voice gets good, it's kind of.

You know, how much of that is, it's going to make its way into what you guys do. I, I have no idea. I think Michael, what you are focused on, and this is very useful is the active phase of treatment. So, and you bring up the computer science metaphor. Let's say the API, the interface, you know, at what level of the hierarchy do intervene in. At the very top, at the very bottom, mid tier. And what's the interface and how, like whether it's bioelectric interface or something. And you know, the, the difference is that, you know, in say trauma therapy with dissociations, we usually have a phased approach where if the patient is dead, it doesn't matter what technique I use. So the first thing we do is stabilization. What I'm trying to say is the API is the relationship with the clinician always. We have a vast amount of literature that without it nothing happens. No matter what avatars or AIs or psychedelics people use because they cannot think, because they feel, you know, they're sort of flooded by affect and they, they can't, you know, take advantage of any communication with any interface. Right. So one is reduction of suicidality, reduction of non suicidal self harm behavior, substance use, basic kind of grounding. And after that we move to perhaps trauma therapy if we see trauma. So we need a model of a condition, is the etiological cause of the symptoms. And we don't target the voice or the dissociation, target the trauma. And then there's a phase of treatment which I think has to do with what you mentioned, which is sort of reintegration where we try to, I mean we generally move back toward that unity, the mental, the subjective unity. And at that point there's possibilities for all these things and, and also in the trauma therapy. But I just wanted to say that this is sort of the pathway we usually go through. And I don't know any way around. Even in, in pharmacological psychiatry we have this interesting thing called psychiatrist effect effect where the exact same medication and exact same doses prescribed by two different psychiatrists and that one has higher efficacy numbers because it is human, it's interaction. And, and this human interaction has biology. The pen system gets activated we're trying to lead the patient from disorganized, feeling insecure in a relationship to earn secure attachment. But then from there we move forward. But we have to build that foundation first. We never just start with like, let's do trauma treatment on the first session or second session conditions.",

And somebody could say, look, there is no algorithm, there's just silicon and copper and electrons right here. You know, this is a fiction. But we all know in computer science that that kind of reduction doesn't actually get you anywhere. That treating the algorithm as the real thing, it really does make the electrons dance in an important sense. And so we're okay with then focusing on managing these patterns that are not the actual. I mean, some people obviously work in hardware, but many people don't. And so I think we can, at least on the biomedical side, I think we can have models in which we treat the actual cellular substrate as the memory, as the tape. That's the scratch pad actually. And what's really driving it is an algorithm that's embedded in some kind of information dynamic that it might be some sort of active inference thing, it might be some other thing. But I do think there is a path there that is not in the sense that we have tools now, we have conceptual and we have practical tools at the bench to start looking at some of these things. I mean, we're, we're now, because of the physiological imaging that's possible now where we can see calcium waves and we can see metabolic states and we can see bioelectric properties and so on, we can see them, we can visualize them in an individual, we can visualize them over time. They move, they move around, they do things, they're causal and by the way they spread across bodies. So we've published something and we have a lot more coming where you have actually multiple frog embryos. In addition, you can watch these patterns move between them. They belong to the group, they don't belong to the individual. And you know, so, so I think, so I think there is some kind of a path there. You know, how much of that is, it's going to make its way into what you guys do. I, I have no idea.",
      "answer": "I think Michael, what you are focused on, and this is very useful is the active phase of treatment. So, and you bring up the computer science metaphor. Let's say the API, the interface, you know, at what level of the hierarchy do intervene in. At the very top, at the very bottom, mid tier. And what's the interface and how, like whether it's bioelectric interface or something. And you know, the, the difference is that, you know, in say trauma therapy with dissociations, we usually have a phased approach where if the patient is dead, it doesn't matter what technique I use. So the first thing we do is stabilization. What I'm trying to say is the API is the relationship with the clinician always. We have a vast amount of literature that without it nothing happens. No matter what avatars or AIs or psychedelics people use because they cannot think, because they feel, you know, they're sort of flooded by affect and they, they can't, you know, take advantage of any communication with any interface. Right. So one is reduction of suicidality, reduction of non suicidal self harm behavior, substance use, basic kind of grounding. And after that we move to perhaps trauma therapy if we see trauma. So we need a model of a condition, is the etiological cause of the symptoms. And we don't target the voice or the dissociation, target the trauma. And then there's a phase of treatment which I think has to do with what you mentioned, which is sort of reintegration where we try to, I mean we generally move back toward that unity, the mental, the subjective unity. And at that point there's possibilities for all these things and, and also in the trauma therapy. But I just wanted to say that this is sort of the pathway we usually go through. And I don't know any way around. Even in, in pharmacological psychiatry we have this interesting thing called psychiatrist effect effect where the exact same medication and exact same doses prescribed by two different psychiatrists and that one has higher efficacy numbers because it is human, it's interaction. And, and this human interaction has biology. The pen system gets activated we're trying to lead the patient from disorganized, feeling insecure in a relationship to earn secure attachment. But then from there we move forward. But we have to build that foundation first. We never just start with like, let's do trauma treatment on the first session or second session conditions.",

At least none that we, that I can, that we can use maybe in a sort of systematically effective way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's exactly right. And one of the, you know, there are sort of more conventional practical uses of these, of these anthrobots is just, you know, they're delivering some sort of specific reparative intervention, whatever. But I think the bigger picture might be that they're actually just vehicles for transplanting behavior patterns or memories. And that's something that people have done. You know, transplantation of memories is a thing that people have done in various animal, animal models and we've done it too in morphogenesis. And one of the wild things about it is that oftentimes it's a very small piece of tissue that you transplant and it somehow takes over the whole thing. So in cases where we've done transplants of pieces of tissue from two headed worms into one headed worms or pieces of tissue into tadpoles that otherwise would have had some sort of severe brain defect. And in many of these cases you get, you get conversion to the new pattern, right? Either normalization or you get the two heads carried over. And it's like why I only introduced a few cells. Why don't they get taken over by the, you know, convinced by the rest of the environment to do that? It's very non linear. You can't really tell. You know, it's not the size of the tissue that matters, it's the, you know, maybe it's something like, you know, how compelling is your message, right? Like the signaling that you're doing. How likely is it to, to actually get alignment of the bigger system that, that you're in something like that. And we see, we see this, this, this kind of battle of like it's funny, if you, if you, if you. In, in an early frog embryo, if you inject some, some cells with a particular potassium channel rna, it makes a voltage that is, is really equivalent to the, the voltage spot that sets up I formation. And so now what you have is a few cells that are saying to their neighbors, let's make an eye. And, and they, and, and this is very much a, a message that goes outwards because there's not enough of them to do it themselves. And so in the cases where you do get an eye, you can section it, you can see that there's actually only very few cells that you injected. What they did was convince all their neighbors to participate. And their name, you know, it was kind of a secondary induction effect. You didn't touch the neighbors. They, they convince them. But, but what typ. But, but what typically happens is there's an interesting battle that goes on because those cells are signaling to their neighbors and let's make an eye. Their neighbors meanwhile are doing their normal tumor suppression thing and they're saying no, your voltage is crazy. You should be skin. And so you should be this, this instead. And, and they, and they fight and, and try to convince each other. And so, and in some cases you get the iron, in some cases you get nothing because, because the skin one and, or the gut cells one and said, this is, you know, you're wrong. And, and, and it actually goes that way. And that's, and that's a way, that's a, that's a very basic thing that, that bodies do to suppress carcinogenic transformations like all, you know, all the time. So, so I think it's quite interesting how you can have these, these things as basically carriers or vehicles of information. And what's really critical is whether that, that story that you're passing on is going to take hold and become convincing and cause alignment within the larger, you know, within the larger system and in particular with behavior. So that's all on the morphology side, on the behavior side. I have been thinking about ways to like these anthrobots. We get them from donated patient tracheal epithelia. And you get this sheet, you get a sheet of information on the patient. And so one of the things that I've been wanting to do is get some from smokers and find out if my anthrobots are now nicotine addicted. Right. Do the anthrobots that come from those cells actually pursue nicotine? And if I were to take those anthropods and stick them into, I don't know, an immunosuppressed mouse or something, would the mouse inherit some of the. Right. Can you, can you actually pass behavioral propensities that way? Wow.",

      "question": "Mike, you've spoken about your, your anthrobot, is that, that's what they're called, right? And, and the notion that, you know, in the future they could be used therapeutically as a sort of non immunogenic agents that, you know, you can put inside the organism and then they can do, they can do their thing. Right. And again, I keep on trying to sort of see other analogies kind of psychologically that, that, that one can do here and it gets, it gets a bit weird, right? But like, is, is there a, you know, is there something that's made out of, of the same psychic DNA as us that is much, much smaller and maybe a bit more stupid, but acting when you've got loads of them, you know, when they're in there, they, you know, they, they can do a good job. And, and which, because it's made from the same sort of stuff as you, doesn't elicit the, you know, the, that sort of rejection. Right. Like, and, and in a way, part of the therapeutic alliance that, I guess what Alexia is talking about is, is, is a smoothing over of that possibility of rejection. I mean, the number of times, the first time I meet a patient, things are pretty rough. And then over, you know, over, over the weeks and months they might smooth down. But. Yeah, and again, there's the. I guess I run the risk of kind of caricaturing things because what Alexei does is so sort of subtle and nuanced and I'm kind of coming at it with all these kind of cell analogies and the like. But, you know, it seems weird that we can think of anthrobots made of cells, but we can't think of similar things made of thoughts or other kind of stuff.

When we're talking anthropods, it seems like mid tier. We're not at the molecular level, we're not at the very top. Right. And if we take your paper on cancer, Michael, I think that you have built the first principles, you have built a high level theory which is tame. And then you have the therapeutic experiments where you're saying, I do this, I restore the communications with the neighbors and the propagation of cancer stops. But in the middle you have a model of a condition of a specific cancer in specific environment. You're saying one aspect of this cancer is that this cancer cell stopped communicating with the neighbors. That's a model. And I'm missing that. With application of, I think your work to clinical psychology, I think that this is where we need to put meat on the bones. It's just saying, what is our model using tame is one of the principles, using your work of schizophrenia is very complex. But even if we take one symptom that we try to do, dissociative symptoms, you know, obsessive symptoms and other things, until then, I think it's very hard to go straight to therapeutics because I think, you know, we go from first principles to, to what to do. And if we take physics as a metaphor, the principles are prescriptive. There's sort of a method of how to do some things right. And then one level down is the mechanic, that's the model which is the Newton's laws, you know, and one way down from that is the dynamics of Kepler or how the, how the, the, the bodily of the planets move. But it's hard, it's hard to go from the first principle straight to the therapeutics or sort of what to do until we have the more nuanced understanding of the specific aspect of a specific disorder. Yeah, yeah, I think that's, I think that's exactly right. And one of the things that we're writing next in the next couple months is I don't know if you've seen, there was a paper that Patrick McMillan in my group did and I on aspects of morphogenesis that are basically reflections of aspects of collective intelligence. So here are the things in development that actually look like intelligence and you know, sort of these protocognitive kind of capabilities. So what I want to do now is I want to do the flip side and I want to do the disorders. So I want to, I want to take a look at what are, what are all the disorders, the known disorders of cognitive systems. And what does that look like in these developmental, you know, is it, is it, you know, every, everything from, from like optical, like illusions of perception. Right. So optical illusions. So that kind of like simple stuff all the way to excessive, you know, to, to, to, to too much certainty about what's going on, not enough certainty. Loss of, loss of, loss of agency, loss of, you know, loss of purpose. I mean, you can, you can sort of stack them, stack them up and just see, see what we already have. And then from there develop some of these connective mid level models. As Alexei was just saying, that would show. Okay, this is, this is going wrong because you've overestimated the, the, the importance of this particular signal. And thus you're, you know, put yourself in this condition. And so then from there we can start to, we can start to develop therapeutics.",

      "question": "I was thinking and listening to you both is, is I find myself a little disoriented because I'm trying to figure out what level of the hierarchy are we talking at? When we're talking anthropods, it seems like mid tier. We're not at the molecular level, we're not at the very top. Right. And if we take your paper on cancer, Michael, I think that you have built the first principles, you have built a high level theory which is tame. And then you have the therapeutic experiments where you're saying, I do this, I restore the communications with the neighbors and the propagation of cancer stops. But in the middle you have a model of a condition of a specific cancer in specific environment. You're saying one aspect of this cancer is that this cancer cell stopped communicating with the neighbors. That's a model. And I'm missing that. With application of, I think your work to clinical psychology, I think that this is where we need to put meat on the bones. It's just saying, what is our model using tame is one of the principles, using your work of schizophrenia is very complex. But even if we take one symptom that we try to do, dissociative symptoms, you know, obsessive symptoms and other things, until then, I think it's very hard to go straight to therapeutics because I think, you know, we go from first principles to, to what to do.

And so then from there we can start to, we can start to develop therapeutics. Super interesting, if I may, because you brought the big elephant in the room. I think throughout your work you're saying all intelligences are collective. And I think we need to talk about it. And I look forward to Thomas, the high level paper that you think about how psychiatry would look like with Michael's principles. But I think we can talk a bit about it. Let me give you a citation. The definition of dissociation in the latest version of the DSM 5 TR is a disruption and or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, bodily representation, motor control and behavior. The integration is deemed normal in the guiding document. And then if I quote a neuroscientist, Daniel Seth, he says that monadic self is A form of a delusion in a sense that it only exists at the level of subjective belief and not an objective outside reality. Then we have your statement that all intelligences are collective. How do we reconcile these things together? What do we do? And I want to give some credit to dsm, you know, it is indeed so that, you know, on average, healthy individuals subjectively feel at the level of phenomenology, the continuity of the mind. You know, it goes back to Emmanuel Kant, 18th century, where. But I am the same as I have been before and I predict to be the same in the future. We even, you know, kind of. We bind together things, you know, we're bind together things. When I listen to you speak, you know, into coherent whole. There's a lot of integration, binding happen and a lot of disorders have to do with disintegration. But the important thing I think is the perspective. Collective intelligence is something that we see from the outside, not from the inside. The way I feel inside my body is at that level as a coherent whole. So perspective is one thing. The second thing is when we wrote in the paper that if we model self as a nested, embedded functional system, then, you know, essentially it's. It's a hierarchical system of beliefs. We. I don't like the annual sets word delusion. I think it pathologizes an important thing. I would say belief or inference. But beliefs can be powerful. They can kill. So I think that. And it's only the higher levels of the self that believe in the unity. The autobiographical self, the core self, the hunger doesn't even have an eye. It's a low blood sugar that compels me to go do something. So this is the higher levels of the. The hierarchy that have the. The unified self. And this is what we, you know, interact with in psychotherapy with a patient. And the final thing is the kind of the distance. You know, if again we have a house and we look at a person moving between different rooms, then they are different and collective, perhaps. But if I'm a mile away and I look at the person in the house, it looks as the same system. So, but, but I. I want to say that they're not. It's not necessarily a paradox. If we qualify at which level of the hierarchy and from which perspective, then we can have unity here and collective there. And we also can have it lower levels of the hierarchy, collective intelligence. Take ant colony. The intelligence of the colony is unified at the next upper level of the hierarchy. That's the definitionally emergent. Emergent property happens at the higher level. So I just wanted to bring it here to discuss.",

I, I promised I wasn't going to bring Buddhism and meditation into it, but I'm, I'm going to now. But yeah, I mean, I think, I think my, my experience and a lot of people who, who do meditate, you know, there's this sort of learning curve that, that happens where you start off. All the mind is, the monkey mind is thinking about all the stuff all the time and, and you know, you kind of eventually get through that and there's a sort of a feeling of maybe some sort of more, more unification. And people use the analogy of, you know, the choppy waters at the top and you get down and it becomes more still. But actually I think a lot of people then realize that when you really get quiet enough, you actually start, you know, that's when the weird stuff starts happening, right? That's when you start hearing sort of strange little voices. Then you don't know where they come from or, or, or, or ideas that are popping into your head that feel like they've just been burped out of nowhere. And yeah, I mean, I think there's a reason that the Buddhist puts so much on the fact that there is no sort of unified self. Because I think at least the phenomenology of some of these states, which are hard won and take a long time to get into, kind of do suggest that, that really when you pay attention there's not that there's not that unity. And also, I mean dream dreams and, and, and, and things that happen to us, you know, throughout the day, I think feel less unified than maybe they, they might.",

And so this is what happens when, when I, when I talk about intelligence of organs and so on. People say, well, I don't feel like my liver is conscious. I'm like, right, the left hemisphere that is talking to me right now will make that claim. And that's great. But, but, but your liver, with whom I cannot yet speak, although we're working on it. But, but that we can't talk to yet, might have a different perspective on this. And of course you don't feel it any more than you feel me being conscious, right? So you don't necessarily. So, you know, it's clear that in the normal human there is a voice that feels unified, for sure. But I'm just, I'm not super sure that there aren't others that normally don't get to speak. And I think we know right from the sodium pentothal experiments and when you put the language hemisphere to sleep and then the split brain studies and all of that, that there's at the very least one other set of opinions in there and probably many more, but, but they're sort of generically suppressed, right? So I think, I think we have to be, we have to be careful about that. But I don't know what you guys think about that.",
      "answer": "No, I, I agree. I, I promised I wasn't going to bring Buddhism and meditation into it, but I'm, I'm going to now. But yeah, I mean, I think, I think my, my experience and a lot of people who, who do meditate, you know, there's this sort of learning curve that, that happens where you start off. All the mind is, the monkey mind is thinking about all the stuff all the time and, and you know, you kind of eventually get through that and there's a sort of a feeling of maybe some sort of more, more unification. And people use the analogy of, you know, the choppy waters at the top and you get down and it becomes more still. But actually I think a lot of people then realize that when you really get quiet enough, you actually start, you know, that's when the weird stuff starts happening, right? That's when you start hearing sort of strange little voices. Then you don't know where they come from or, or, or, or ideas that are popping into your head that feel like they've just been burped out of nowhere. And yeah, I mean, I think there's a reason that the Buddhist puts so much on the fact that there is no sort of unified self. Because I think at least the phenomenology of some of these states, which are hard won and take a long time to get into, kind of do suggest that, that really when you pay attention there's not that there's not that unity. And also, I mean dream dreams and, and, and, and things that happen to us, you know, throughout the day, I think feel less unified than maybe they, they might.",

And if, and if one wants to sit home and watch TV and the other one has to go to work, then there's an issue. But if, but if actually you can, there's some version of VR or some other thing.

They're all navigating the maze together. And the, the, the idea, I don't know if it's so much as fight for the real estate, but one of the prominent theories is that integration was too painful. If I remember I, the coherent whole, it hurts too much. So I'm going to compartmentalize and I'm going to move into this piece where it hurts less. You know, it's sort of, as Frank Putnam said, one of the experts in the field, it's, it's the escape when there's no other escape, escapes. These are prolonged cases of neglect and abuse when really it feels inescapable. And what the extreme defenses is, I'm going to break my mind into pieces.
