However, there have been studies showing that DC (static) magnetic fields can also interact with living systems at various levels. Effects on in vitro biochemical reactions have been reported. Perhaps most interestingly, it is seen that a 50 mT DC magnetic field can alter the structure of poly-L-lysine. Behavioral effects of DC fields have also been noted. For example, strong static magnetic fields are avoided by mice and worker ants, though apparently a DC magnetic field of about 0.1 mT increases bee life-span by more than 60%. Weak static fields affect the choice of motion of flatworms, snails, and paramecia, while medium-strength static fields have been used as conditioning stimuli for bees and rabbits, and a 7 mT static field disrupted honey-bee dancing.

It has been reported that 1 T fields are lethal to young mice, and that a 14 T field stopped sea-urchin development, but did not affect Drosophila and mouse development. A weaker, 420 mT field, caused embryo death and dissolution in the wombs of mice. Klueber showed that 5 mT static magnetic fields produced dramatic teratogenic effects in the eye and nervous system of developing chick embryos. Static magnetic fields of 0.4 mT retarded development of the pigeon embryo, and exposure of chick embryos to a 500 mT field for just 1 hour produced poor brain development with an open neural tube, shortening of the embryonic long axis, and slight heart displacement. Neurath showed that in many organisms, gastrulation is halted in fields with a gradient of 8.35 T/cm, and Drosophila cuticular abnormalities resulted from brief exposures to static magnetic fields. 1 T DC fields caused axial anomalies in frog embryos. Regeneration, a non-embryonic example of large-scale morphogenesis is also affected by DC fields, as DC fields accelerate tail regeneration in tadpoles; the effect exhibits exposure time and field strength dependence.",

The sea urchin is an excellent and well-studied developmental system, and the presence of static magnetic field effects on its development would afford a tractable model for studying field-cell interactions, as well as the normal processes of development by providing a new perturbing factor. In one sense, static field effects are more interesting, because unlike AC fields, they cannot cause ionic currents. While our initial studies showed that weak AC magnetic fields can affect the mitotic timing of sea urchin embryos, and Kholodov reports that a high-strength (14 T) static magnetic field arrests sea-urchin development, there have been very few experimental studies of applied medium-strength static field effects on sea-urchin embryogenesis. In this study we report that such fields are able to cause a delay in the mitotic cycle of early embryos, and to greatly increase the incidence of exogastrulation, a well-characterized developmental abnormality in sea urchins. Thus, we show that in the sea urchin model, static magnetic fields are a potent teratogen and that the mitotic cycle is sensitive to these low-energy fields as well as to AC fields.",

Semen was collected dry from the genital pores with a Pasteur pipette and held undiluted in a tube on ice until fertilization. Eggs were collected by inverting the spawning females onto beakers of Millipore-filtered sea water (MPFSW). The suspension of eggs was filtered through several layers of cheesecloth and settled on ice through fresh MPFSW three times. Eggs were suspended to a final concentration of 1-2% (V:V) in MPFSW. Fertilization was accomplished by adding a freshly prepared dilute sperm suspension to the eggs to result in a final sperm concentration of about 1:10,000 (V:V). Successful fertilization was determined by elevation of the fertilization membrane, generally within 90 sec. of sperm addition. Fertilization was greater than 95% in all experiments. Experiments were carried out with eggs produced from several females to minimize effects of individual differences. Embryos in 250 ml beakers were cultured with stirring in an incubator at 13-16 °C depending on the species.",

The first series of experiments was designed to maximize the possibility of detecting effects arising from exposure to static magnetic fields. Immediately following fertilization, L. pictus embryos were divided into two equal volumes; one culture was exposed to a 30 mT static field (Fig. 1) for the duration of the experiment. The other culture received no exposure except for the ambient geomagnetic field. All other conditions of culture remained the same. At 26 hours post-fertilization, samples of each culture were taken and scored for percentage of embryos which had hatched. Hatching is an easily recognizable developmental event, resulting from blastula-stage embryos acquiring motility and secreting an enzyme which digests the fertilization membrane (reviewed: Okazaki, 1975). The results are summarized in Table 1, and demonstrate that at 26 hours 82% of the control embryos had hatched, while only 36% of the exposed embryos had done so (p<0.01). Additional experiments with L. pictus and S. purpuratus revealed that in both species, exposure to 30 mT static magnetic fields significantly delays hatching relative to control groups (data not shown).",

Consequently, we studied the effect of exposure on the time of the first two cell divisions. A batch of eggs was split in two immediately following fertilization, and one culture was exposed to a 30 mT magnetic field (Fig. 1). At 3.75 hours, approximately 100 embryos from each culture were scored for cell division. Four times as many exposed eggs relative to controls remained undivided (Table 2).

This made it possible to plot the number of divisions as a function of time, and then compare exposed and control batches of embryos. Cell divisions in early sea urchin embryos are well synchronized; previously, we have demonstrated that when a batch of fertilized eggs is split and sampled every 15 min., the maximum endogenous variation of the time of cell division is 3 min. (Levin and Ernst, 1995). Thus, differences greater than ±3 min. were taken to be significant in the experiments below. Since the endogenous variation is known, it was possible to study the effects of exposure to the 30 mT static field on the time of the first two cell divisions. After fertilization, the embryos were split into two cultures, one of which was immediately exposed to the field throughout the experiment, while the other served as a control. The cultures were sampled every 15 min. without interruption of the field, and roughly 200 embryos from each culture were scored for the number of blastomeres. The results are shown in Figure 2. By calculating the time difference between the midpoints of each cell division phase on the plot, it is seen that the field induces an insignificant delay (1 minute) in the first cell division, and a small but significant delay of 6 min. in the second.",

In L. pictus cultures exposed to a 30 mT field continuously from fertilization and incubated for 48-94 hours, we noticed an apparent increase in the incidence of exogastrulation. Exogastrulation is a well-known developmental abnormality in sea urchins where the archenteron, the primitive gut, evaginates forming outside of the embryo instead of invaginating (Nocente-McGrath et al., 1991). To test directly the effect of a 30 mT static field on L. pictus gastrulation, embryos were fertilized and the culture split in half, with one half serving as a control and the other exposed to the field. Gastrulation is normally initiated about 24 hours post-fertilization in L. pictus, followed by the morphological differentiation of the gut. Cultures were scored for exogastrulation at 2-3 days.",

These results are surprising and at present we do not have a unifying model for a mechanism that could account for the diverse effects. Exposure to a 30 mT static field resulted in delays in the time of the first two cell divisions of sea urchin embryos. Since the slopes of the division profile curves are roughly equal between the exposed and control embryos (e.g. Figure 4), it can be concluded that the field increases the time spent in the G1, G2, or S phases of the cell cycle, rather than slowing down cytokinesis itself. The delay in the time of cell division seems to be an effect of the static field on the egg instead of the sperm. It is interesting to note that the static field produces relatively equal delays for the 1st and 2nd cell divisions (Figure 5), when compared to our earlier studies where exposure to an AC field produced much larger accelerations for the 2nd cell division than for the first (Levin and Ernst, 1995). The AC field seems to shorten each mitotic cycle, while the static field appears to act once, before the 1st cell division and most likely, before fertilization, since it is seen that earlier pre-fertilization exposures have greater effects.",

Rather a bell-curve relationship around a maximal value is observed which may represent some sort of habituation process within the egg. This observation is potentially quite important since most EMF-exposure guidelines are designed to limit the field magnitude, and the amount of time a person spends within a field. Thus, our data suggest that the crucial parameter may not be how long a biological system is exposed to the field (since Figure 5 shows, shorter exposures can produce a larger effect), but rather how the timing of exposure relates to key biological events. The exposure timing which produces that maximal delay in S. purpuratus is 15 min. pre-fertilization. The 17 minute delay may be a maximum effect that can be achieved by this field, since it is the same for both divisions, whereas the other experiments show slightly greater delays for the 2nd division. The same bell-shaped relationship was seen in L. pictus (data not shown), resulting in a slightly different optimal timing (30 min. pre-fertilization), and a somewhat greater delay (22 min.) than for S. purpuratus.",

      "text": "The effects described were most likely due to the applied DC field. The small stirring motors produced no detectable AC fields at the level of the magnets. Though we cannot formally completely rule out the possibility of very weak eddy currents being induced in the magnets by stray AC fields, this is extremely unlikely to cause the effects described above since previous experiments have indicated that somewhat weaker ceramic magnets used in exactly the same experimental setup have no effects (data not shown). The static field cannot induce heating and is several orders of magnitude weaker than fields which have been shown to cause changes in membranes' electrical properties (Kholodov, 1971). Furthermore, ferrous molecules are not known to occur in sea urchins. However, our results demonstrate that static fields containing very little energy (same order of magnitude as average kinetic energy due to thermal motion) can significantly affect important biological processes. DC magnetic fields can, however, alter the velocity of motion of ions. Under appropriate conditions, small changes in the behavior of ions could cause significant effects. For example, alterations in velocity would affect the interactions between ions and receptor channels. Similarly, small changes in the behavior of ions that are components of signal transduction pathways could produce dramatic changes. Interestingly, lithium, the classic inducer of exogastrulation in sea urchins (reviewed: Nocente-McGrath et al., 1991) is proposed to act by secondary-messenger pathways in several different cell types (reviewed: Berridge et al., 1989). Still, there is no immediately obvious mechanism that can account for the various developmental effects we observe. Some possibilities are induced changes in trajectories of moving ions such as Ca++ near membranes, electric currents induced by the motion of the conductive cytoplasm of the urchins through the static field as they are being stirred, and conformational changes in the structure of regulatory proteins (Verma and Goldner, 1996).",
