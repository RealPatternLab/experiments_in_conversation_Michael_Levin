We also thank all our contributors and reviewers. Bioelectricity is going from strength to strength! This is our biggest ordinary issue to date with three perspectives and four original research articles plus a revamped section on \"Bioelectricity Buzz,” highlighting some interesting articles published elsewhere that our readers might also like to be aware of. We hope that you will enjoy this varied section that our Media Editor, Ann Rajnicek, has brilliantly put together. You will notice that the Buzz includes neuroscience among the highlighted topics and although we all know that there is a plethora of neuroscience journals, we would like Bioelectricity also to be home for such articles.",

As a start, as you can see, the journal is now subtitled \"Science, Engineering, and Medicine” to make it explicit that bioelectricity as a discipline covers the whole spectrum and our journal intends to cater for this scope. As a further step, therefore, we have started reorganizing the editorial board and are delighted to welcome Dr. Utkan Demirci, from Stanford University School of Medicine, as a senior editor. Dr. Demirci, an expert on microfluidics, works at the interface between micro/nanoscale engineering and medicine.",
