Over these 5 years, the journal received its first impact factor (2.3), a solid start, and its CiteScore has risen to 4.0 from 1.6.  We have published nine special issues on diverse topics ranging from plants and microbes to cancer, and we continue to seek compelling themes.  Our editorial board has expanded, and we express our gratitude to all members for their dedicated work and to our authors for their valuable contributions.  Bioelectricity maintains a global presence, having published articles from 30 countries over the past 5 years.",

Bioelectricity is now the official journal of ISEBTT, and several society members have joined our editorial board, including two as associate editors. We aim to strengthen this partnership in the coming years.  The field of bioelectricity has seen remarkable publications, highlighted in the \"Buzz\" section.  The \"My Experiments in Bioelectricity\" series, featuring insights from senior scientists, and meeting reports provide valuable perspectives. Sally Adee's book \"We Are Electric\" generated significant interest, and we were pleased to interview her.",

The urgency with which governments, companies, and individuals funded research led to vaccines that saved millions of lives. This same principle applies to bioelectricity, which holds immense promise across diverse fields. From biomedicine and bioengineering to agriculture, the positive impacts of bioelectricity will be felt globally as the technology transitions from academic labs to practical applications.",
