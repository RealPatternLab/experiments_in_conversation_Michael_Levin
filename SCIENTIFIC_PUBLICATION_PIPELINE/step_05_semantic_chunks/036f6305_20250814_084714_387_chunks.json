It is important to determine what kinds of spatio-temporal patterns may be obtained by such a method, and what the characteristics of such a morphogenetic process might be. This paper presents a computer model of morphogenesis based on gene activity driven by interpreting a positional information field. In this model, the interactions of mutually-regulating developmental genes are viewed as a map from R² to R2, and are modeled by the complex number algebra. Functions in complex variables are used to simulate genetic interactions resulting in position-dependent differentiation. This is shown to be equivalent to computing modified Julia sets, and is seen to be sufficient to produce a very rich set of morphologies which are similar in appearance and several important characteristics to those of real organisms.",

The rapidly growing field of Artificial Life uses computer models to emphasize the common processes and characteristics of living things, rather than their physico-chemical implementation. The accent is on the role of bioinformation, cybernetic control processes, complexity and systems theory, rather than the study of specific instances of physicochemical processes (Apter, 1966, Narendra and Thompson, 1986, Langton, 1990, Langton, 1991). \"Computer simulations provide the experimental biologist with a much needed means for doing experiments on theories. We usually think of experiments as something performed on cells, to determine whether the cells' responses will match predictions made by a theory. However, when dealing with complex phenomena and with correspondingly complex theories, what a given hypothesis predicts can be less than obvious. It can be even more difficult to perceive which components in the hypothesis give rise to a particular prediction, much less to know what alternative classes of hypothesis would have predicted the same results. Lastly, anyone with sufficient insight to predict the consequences of a given theory may need objective methods for proving it to others. Computer simulations can help solve all these problems.\" (Harris, 1990) This approach is at the intersection of biology, mathematics, physics, and computer science, and has mainly involved computer models of behavior or evolution.",

      "text": "Some attempts to model various developmental phenomena (such as cell proliferation, cleavage, cell migration, specific pattern formation, etc.) by creating computer simulations of the behavior of the underlying components have been made (Ransom, 1981, and Meinhardt, 1982, are good summaries of such efforts). Interesting special cases are found in Düchting and Vogelsaenger, 1984 and 1985, and Thom, 1983. Good examples of the common \"bottom-up\" model (where the desired phenomenon emerges from a simulation of empirically-derived behaviors of lower-level components) can be found in Goel and Rogers, 1978, and Rogers and Goel, 1978. In the \"top-down\" model (sometimes termed \"informal\", Conrad, 1981), the researcher creates a computer simulation which behaves like the system modeled (in some interesting way), without too much regard for the empirical validity of specific lower-level components; the model's empirical fitness is tested at a higher level. This approach can be used to study characteristics of processes or general schemes. For example, one may create a well-fitting model of some animal's social behavior based on general principles of cooperation, game theory, and information theory, without any regard as to whether the components of the equations have any physical counterparts in the animal's brain (for example, Krebs et al., 1978, Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981). These kinds of models usually precede bottom-up models, and are much more common in ethology, evolutionary theory, and the cognitive sciences than in developmental biology. Excellent examples of top-down models are given in Raup and Michelson, 1965, Rozenberg and Salomaa, 1986, and Slack, 1991. L-systems (Lindenmeyer, 1989, Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmeyer, 1990) are among the best examples of top-down models because they possess the appropriate higher-order behavior even though there is no known physical mechanism in plants which explicitly implements the symbol manipulation rules used in an L-system. Kauffman's work (1969, 1974, 1990) with dynamics of abstract logic elements networks is another good example, since these studies capture higher-order rules governing gene interactions without using characteristics of real genes.",

      "text": "Whereas the bottom-up model tries to be as realistic and focused as possible, providing empirically-accurate data of some narrow and specific aspect of development (for example, Ransom et al., 1984, and Meinhardt, 1984), the top-down model attempts to derive the overall pattern of control, information flow, and higher-order characteristics at the cost of losing some lower-level realism. Bottom-up models are able to provide more concrete information about some narrowly-defined process; the benefit of the top-down model is that it allows insight into the higher-order properties of processes, and can be used when sufficient data and/or theory for a bottom-up model is not available. These models are useful in the study of developmental morphogenesis because embryonic development is very likely to involve general mechanisms of increasing complexity; at the same time, much low-level data (such as quantitative mechanisms of gene interactions) is currently unavailable. This paper presents a positional field-driven model of development which is intermediate between the bottom-up and top-down types. The original model described in this paper attempts a wider view of the control processes of development, by modeling cell decisions controlled by field-specified positional information. The model has a strong bottom-up component in that it is based on a process which is known to be crucial in bio-morphogenesis - determination of cell fates via gene interactions. It is top-down in that it is not a simulation of any specific actual organism, but of a type of process - positional information interpretation based on genetic interactions. It is not being claimed that the specific formulas (used below) describe any existent organism; rather, it is a computer implementation of a possible morphogenetic control process. Thus, the strength of the model is not based on the fact that the images produced may look like biological forms; it lies in the fact that the model can be used to study the higher-order properties of field-directed gene interactions in morphogenesis. It makes several concrete predictions, and explains several key phenomena. When quantitative information on morphogenetic gene interactions becomes available, it can be used within the context of the model described herein to make concrete predictions about specific organisms.",

      "text": "Positional information and field concepts in biology The basic problem of pattern formation can be viewed from one (or a combination) of two general perspectives. The developing organism's resulting morphology can be seen as a product of subunits following a sort of master plan - a blueprint (at some level of detail) of the whole organism. Or, it may be an emergent phenomenon, where the overall pattern emerges as the result of purely local interactions between subunits governed by rules which say nothing about the overall pattern (best exemplified by cellular automata systems, as in Gutowitz, 1991). An intermediate paradigm involves positional information (Wolpert, 1969, 1971, 1989). That is, each unit (usually thought of as a cell, but this could apply equally well to tissues, cell sheets, or sub-cellular components) is able to determine its position within the organism, and act (differentiate, migrate, proliferate, etc.) based upon that positional information. The positional information is usually thought of as coordinates in a field, which then can be a mechanism for long-range control and information transfer (see Cooke, 1975 for a review of field theories in biology). The paradigm is thus a combination of the two approaches in that it includes both purely local decision-making (with an emphasis on the distinction between the field itself, and various components' responses to it), as well as a global entity (the positional information field itself). In this view, the overall morphology emerges from units following rules which specify actions based on the unit's position; the process of morphogenesis can be \"characterized as a series of solutions of the morphogenetic field whose superposition gives way to complex stable patterns.\" (Goodwin, 1988). The role of positional information in early development is reviewed in Bard, 1990, and Slack, 1991; there is also evidence that adult animals maintain positional information cues (Harrison, 1918, Raff and Kauffman, 1983).",

Field theories are useful in explaining the phenomena of cleavage (for example, Goodwin and Trainor, 1980), regeneration (for example, Tevlin and Trainor, 1985, Mittenthal and Nuelle, 1988), supernumerary limb production (for example, Bryant and Iten, 1976, Mittenthal and Trevarrow, 1984, Gardiner and Bryant, 1989), and cancer and malignancy (Matioli, 1987). Two interesting top-down field-based models are given by Evans (1986), and Thompson (1961). Evans' model involves generation of morphologies very similar to that of the human fetus, based on electromagnetic field characteristics of the nervous system. Thompson (1961, Palmer, 1957) show that it is possible to convert between the morphologies of various existing animals by applying simple mathematical deformations to their 2-dimensional field representations. Field theories must specify several characteristics of the process: the physical nature of the field, what exactly perceives this information, what the time characteristics of field perception are, and how the field is in turn modified by the units which read it.",

This self-similarity implies that the algorithm itself, with a given formula, dictates a specific shape, and this shape is basically the same in many regions of the field, at different resolutions. This means that 1) field values are relative, not absolute, and experiments with field-directed developmental systems can be done to test this, and that 2) parts of the field contain information for the whole organism.",

      "text": "This \"holographic\" property of the model is interesting in light of the ability of many kinds of embryos (at certain stages) to regenerate from pieces, and recover the whole organism when pieces are removed. As with real embryos, not every region contains the crucial information, and only some regions can be \"magnified\" into the proper morphology. Real embryos also possess this \"relativity\" of positional information (for example, in certain cases in early Drosophila axis formation, it's the relative concentrations of two morphogens which matter, not their absolute concentrations). During morphogenesis there is a \"matching of proportionate spatial structures to the size of the field in which the pattern is formed. It appears as if a size-sensing mechanism exists which controls and adapts the detailed structures in accordance with the variable field size, so that their relative extent remains invariant\" (Papageorgiou and Venieratos, 1983). This is seen in the experiments on Xenopus (Cooke, 1973c, Cooke, 1979, Cooke, 1981), hydra (Bode and Bode, 1980), and a unicellular ciliate (Bakowska and Jerka-Dziadosz, 1980).",

      "text": "How might this property be supported by a morphogenetic field? In general, patterns generated by diffusion reactions are very sensitive to changes of scale. However, a variation on Turing's early model (Othmer and Pate, 1980) of spatial formation based on morphogen reaction-diffusion systems also exhibits scale-invariance. A theoretical basis for morphogen gradient fields which exhibit scale-invariance is given in Papageorgiou and Venieratos, 1983. In general, these images show that only two interacting genes are sufficient to produce rich morphologies from a smooth and continuous positional information field. This is an important result because it provides a convenient and biochemically plausible mechanism for how organismic complexity arises from two simple orthogonal vectors. Figure 34 shows a low-structure morphology. Note the simple circular layers of aggregated (mixed-color) tissue, and the simplicity of the formula by which it is produced. Note also that the image is radially symmetrical, except for a small horizontal line on the right. Figure 35 shows the same formula as Figure 34, with an additional component. Notice that this is a somewhat more complicated morphology, with modifications to the simple circular membrane of Figure 34, but still much simpler than any of the other figures.",

Another interesting example is seen in Figure 41 (this is just a magnification of the area overlaid by the dashed rectangle in Figure 1): note the complex behavior that occurs where two separate structures overlap.

Several things can be studied in this way: constants in the formula itself, the limit used in the cutoff point, the intercellular constant (υ), etc. The parametrization studies described below show that smoothly changing gene co-regulation functions from R² to R² are sufficient to produce the kinds of spatio-temporal processes that are observed in biological embryogenesis.",
