Due to the radial arrangement of the muscles around the pigment sacculus a radial distribution of the pigments is expected: a higher density in the center and a progressively lower density towards the edges of the sacculus; conversely this implies a low reflectance intensity from the central area of the chromatophores and a higher reflectance intensity from the edges.",
