    "abstract": "The relationship between humans and technology has attracted increasing attention with the advent of ever more powerful technologies. However, ethical considerations often focus on the potential misuse of tools of serving human needs, but rather as a partner that is rich in technological attributes. Our model of ontology and ethics, as the basis for understanding SCIs needs to respond to perceived shortcoming of their substrates, all intelligent agents can be understood as needing feedback loops (SCI loops) for virtual homeostasis and persistence and proposing simpler care as an intelligible tool as only a minimal virtuality of homeostasis, a self-organizing agent requires a self-organizing environment. We formulate and explain the SCI loop as an acknowledgement of Maturana's and Varela's concern, by finding the boundaries.",

Agents are seen as systems moved by homeostatic stress, i.e. by their perceptions of a mismatch between current and optimal circumstances. They respond to such stresses with an aim to overcome them, and so care drives agents in their pursuit of an intelligent solution to their stress-defined challenges. This loop is a fundamental component of biological beings, arising shortly after fertilization in the process that remodels each embryonic stage into the next stage, by reducing error against a species-specific target morphology (Levin, 2022b).",
