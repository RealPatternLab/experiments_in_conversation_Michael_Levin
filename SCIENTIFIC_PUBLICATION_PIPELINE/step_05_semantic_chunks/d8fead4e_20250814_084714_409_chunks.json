      "text": "Manrique, Friston, and Walker highlight the importance of communal adoption of innovations, using the example of the handaxe.  Inventing a tool, understanding its use, and even replicating its production are insufficient for its long-term establishment.  The innovation must also be recognized and adopted by the community, requiring a shift in their understanding of the environment and its affordances.  This communal uptake is crucial for the innovation to persist in the anthropological record, similar to the requirement for \"hopeful monsters\" to find mates.  The handaxe inventor's discovery might be overlooked by their peers, hindering the spread and preservation of the innovation.",

      "text": "The handaxe example reveals two key aspects of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference. Firstly, the FEP, while grounded in physics, applies to complex, multi-component systems, including individual cells and multicellular organisms. These systems possess hierarchical control mechanisms (\"minds\") and hierarchical bodies with specific capabilities. Secondly, the relevant \"system of interest\" is typically a group, not an individual.  Therefore, impactful inference is federated, emphasizing the importance of tool cultures that standardize and preserve capabilities over time, rather than isolated instances of tool use.",

      "text": "The FEP's robustness stems from ubiquitous redundancy and error-correction capacity. However, redundancy can also be a challenge, as multiple components must accept an innovation for it to persist. Copying from a single source, like DNA replication, shifts the problem to another level, as seen in gene duplication. This necessitates community agreement within the new context.  The handaxe parable leads to the question of what facilitates community recognition of innovations and enables federated inference. Why would collectives heed minority voices? This question applies to various levels of biological organization, from microbial mats to biochemical pathways and nucleic acids. In humans, language emerges as a key factor.",

Innovations in communication themselves require community recognition and adoption.  A language used solely by one individual is ineffective. The debate about the origin of language, whether from a single protolanguage or multiple sources, is further complicated by large language models (LLMs).  These models challenge the notion of a single, innate universal grammar.  If languages are like handaxes, the question arises: how many language-like systems emerged and disappeared before achieving widespread adoption?",

The possibility of multiple \"origins of language\" events, with only a few contributing to extant languages, parallels questions in origin-of-life studies.  Raup and Valentine's work suggests multiple independent origins might be necessary for one lineage to survive.  Even a single origin could involve numerous dead-end lineages.  Adopted innovations become ladders for future progress, offering advantages to groups possessing them, while potentially hindering those lacking them.  Advanced tools like handaxes and language can be advantageous in intergroup competition, but also escalate conflict, potentially leading to bottlenecks or extinction.",
