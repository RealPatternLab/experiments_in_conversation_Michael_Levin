      "text": "In this paper we introduced the first agent-based model of structure discovery and repair which allows 3D cell structure to discover their organization and repair it from damages occurring due to cell death. We demonstrated the efficacy of the mechanism in large set of simulations of random cell death occurring at different rates in simulated body shaped as a Planarian. For even high cell death rates, we found parameters for the proposed cell-to-cell communication mechanisms that could maintain the structure indefinitely.",
