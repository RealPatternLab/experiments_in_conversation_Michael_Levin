His work significantly advanced our understanding of how electrical signals influence cell behavior and tissue patterning.  Borgens pioneered the use of applied electric fields to stimulate regeneration in damaged tissues, particularly in the nervous system. His research explored the mechanisms by which endogenous bioelectric signals regulate cell migration, differentiation, and growth, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches to treat injuries and birth defects.",

He was a prolific and tireless worker, producing a steady stream of important articles across the 1970s and subsequent six decades. He published some of the best functional data showing that endogenous transepithelial electrical gradients were important for limb development and regeneration.",

He was especially interested in neural regeneration, such as spinal cord repair, and treated numerous dogs with spinal cord repair strategies in his veterinary applications.
