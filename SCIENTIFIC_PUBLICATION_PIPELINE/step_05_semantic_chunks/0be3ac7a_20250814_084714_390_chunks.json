      "text": "All interesting questions, including those of interest to the biomedical community, can be reformulated as searches in some appropriate space. For example, when one wants to design a molecule that binds some particular protein, one is searching for some element (or elements, or even subspace) in the space of all possible molecules. When one wants to optimally allocate hospital resources among some group of patients, one is searching for a satisfactory allocation strategy in the space of all possible strategies. When one is trying to develop a theory or a model that explains some set of phenomena, one is searching the space of all possible theories for the simplest one which fits the given data. Any search task has several components. One needs to define a search space (the abstract form or structure of all possible entities that are being searched through), and an evaluation function (a precise way to evaluate any member of this search space and decide on its \"quality\" - how good or useful a solution it is). In the above examples, and in general, the space that needs to be searched is immense, and often of unknown dimensionality (for example, how many independent parameters are sufficient to enumerate all possible theories?). Several methods exist for effectively searching these kinds of spaces. Scientists commonly use heuristics and creative insight to achieve this. This process, however, is highly non-algorithmic, and thus difficult to simulate on the computer.",

And, while several common heuristic methods exist, they are often ineffective on deceptive or difficult spaces. This refers to spaces with strong nonlinearities, such that elements that are close together in the space have widely differing qualities. For example, when a molecule that is pretty good at catalyzing some biochemical activity, there will often be almost identical (and thus in the search space, neighboring) molecules that are very poor at this task because of single residues which cause steric hindrances etc. Such spaces are deceptive because one point in the space doesn't always give much information about its neighbors. This can cause gradient methods to become trapped in local maxima (regions of good solutions which are far away from sets of much better solutions and thus form dead-ends for the search).",

Genetic Algorithms (GAs [1]) and their relatives in the wide field of Evolutionary Computation can endow a search with the power of evolution. The basic idea, analogously with biological evolution, is that an initially random set of candidate solutions to some problem is evaluated. The top few percent are kept, while the rest are discarded. These top few are recombined and randomly mutated to form the next generation's set. This process is iterated until a satisfactory solution is found. Note that this procedure is completely algorithmical (and thus easily given to computer implementations), and requires no domain-specific knowledge or user intervention - the search proceeds using only the information inherent in the search space itself. Likewise, the algorithm is domain-independent, and can be adapted to almost any task.",

How is a random set of points, driven by what looks like a randomized hill-climbing search algorithm, going to be improved in a difficult and immense search space? There are two answers to this objection. The empirical answer is that it seems to work, and very effectively indeed. References 3-8 give many examples where this type of algorithm has worked on various difficult tasks. The theoretical answer is motivated by biological evolution. One is hard-pressed to come up with a more difficult search space than that of biological phenotypes. Due to genetic pleitropy, and the fantastically complex interactions that go on during embryonic development, it hardly seems plausible that random mutation and differential reproduction are sufficient to account for the myriad of marvelously-adapted organisms we observe today. At all levels, from biochemicals to organs and whole organisms, each system seems so finely tuned that any random alteration will ruin its function completely (these matters are dealt with in [2]). Yet evolution obviously works, and the basic algorithm outlined above is seen to be sufficient to successfully traverse an extremely difficult search space². By pursuing a population of solutions simultaneously, letting useful features propagate through selection, and recombining parts of solutions, GAs are often able to effectively search complex and many-dimensional search spaces and avoid being trapped on local maxima.",

For example, if one was searching for an animal which matched certain characteristics, it would be a poor choice to arrange the data in order of alphabetical name. This is because animals whose names are alphabetically close (worms and wombats) will not tend to have similar characteristics. A much better choice in this case would be a tree-like arrangement which preserves phylogenetic relationships, because then close points on this tree would represent animals which are likely to be similar. This makes for a non-deceptive landscape, and maximizes the effectiveness of a GA approach. Finally, the choice of representation may suggest one computer language over another.

Usually, this function (which is called repeatedly to evaluate every member of the population, in each generation) is where most of the compute-time is spent, so most optimization effort should be directed at it. The fitness function should be scaled, so that 1.0 represents a perfect solution, and so that it is as linear as possible (i.e., avoid functions which give all-or-nothing grades; partial credit works best). 3) mutation and recombination operators: for evolution to take place, one must have a means for producing new genomes. There are two types of operators: mutation and crossover (although sometimes, more exotic operators such as inversion, duplication, deletion, etc. can be used). Mutation randomly alters some aspect of a member, while cross-over performs an exchange of genetic material (of the member's information) between two members. For example: if a representation is a vector of numbers, mutation can simply change one or more of those numbers by some small offset, while crossover swaps one or more numbers between two individuals; if a representation is a decision or parse tree, mutation can replace nodes or cut or add branches, while crossover can swap branches at defined points; etc.",

For example, the expression \"3 ÷ x\" can be mutated to \"3 ÷ 0\", which cannot be evaluated. Four strategies are possible for dealing with this: • protected operators - define special functions (in this case, a protected divide function) which watch for illegal inputs, and return pre-defined values (in this case, 0 or 3 are both reasonable choices); • \"hand of God\" - one can have a special routine that scans for and removes illegal individuals prior to evaluation; • \"dog-eat-dog\" - one can simply assign a fitness of 0.0 to illegal members, without evaluating them at all - they will then tend to die out; • \"Lamark's revenge\" - one can define smart mutation and crossover operators that are context-sensitive and never produce illegal members; Which of these strategies is chosen depends on the representation. If there is a natural way to exclude illegal members when mutating, the last method is preferable. If not, the first is probably best. 4) GA parameters: besides all of the parameters of the specific task, a GA has a set of its own parameters, all of which can be tuned to achieve better performance. The particular values are application specific (and thus are to be determined by experiment), but some hints can be given. These parameters include: • population size (P) - the bigger the population, the more chance of finding a good solution. Population sizes are generally on the order of between 100 and",
