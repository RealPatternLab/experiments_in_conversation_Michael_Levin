[PAGE 1] Introduction
Members of the TGF-B superfamily regulate crucial aspects of vertebrate development. This is particularly evident in Xenopus where the interplay between BMP and activin/nodal signaling is required for patterning during gastrulation. Activin/nodal-like ligands direct both the induction and specification of mesoderm and endoderm along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, while at the same time BMPs suppress dorsal and trunk mesoderm and neural fates (Harland and Gerhart, 1997; Kimelman and Griffin, 2000; Schier, 2003; Whitman, 1998). Later in development, activins and nodals are key determinants in the establishment of left-right asymmetry and patterning of the nervous system while BMPs play a critical role in the formation of many tissues and organs including neural crest, heart, limb and skeleton (Hogan, 1996; Schier, 2003).

BMPs and activin exert their effects through a signaling cascade in which ligand binding brings together type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface (Massague and Chen, 2000). Once activated, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates receptor regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads). These phosphorylated R-Smads then complex with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus and together with other proteins regulate transcription of target genes. R-Smads 2,3 are phosphorylated to initiate signaling by activin-like ligands while R-Smads1,5,8 are phosphorylated during BMP signal transduction (Massague and Chen, 2000; Miyazawa et al., 2002). While BMPs and activins are able to bind to the same type II receptors (activin type II and IIB), they have separate type I receptors and it is through the type I receptor/R-Smad pairings that a specific BMP or activin signal is propagated. In addition, BMPs signal through BMP-specific receptor complexes that utilize BMPRII, a receptor not used by activin-like ligands (Massague and Chen, 2000; Miyazawa et al., 2002). The flexible nature of these BMP and activin ligand-receptor interactions allows them to serve as multifunctional regulators during development and organogenesis, but at the same time signaling by these factors must be tightly controlled both spatially and temporally to ensure specificity. The most common level of control over TGF-B-like signals takes place in the extracellular space where antagonists like noggin, chordin, follistatin, gremlin and cerberus prevent ligands from binding to their receptors (Balemans and Van Hul, 2002; Miyazono, 2000). Control of signaling also occurs at the cell membrane, as well as within the cytoplasm and nucleus of the target cell (Miyazono, 2000; von Bubnoff and Cho, 2001).

BMP-3, a member of the TGF-B superfamily, has biological effects that oppose those of osteogenic BMPs and TGF-B1 in a variety of mammalian systems (Daluiski et al., 2001; Faucheux et al., 1997). In Xenopus embryos, we and others have shown that unlike BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-7, which are potent ventralizing agents, BMP-3 induces dorsalization (Daluiski et al., 2001; Hino et al., 2003). These effects of BMP-3 are most similar to the BMP antagonists noggin, chordin and follistatin, inhibiting the mesoderm-inducing activities of BMP-2 and ADMP in animal cap assays (Hino et al., 2003). xBMP-3b, a molecule 83% homologous to xBMP-3, can also antagonize BMP-like ligands as well as nodal-like proteins (Hino et al., 2003). While these data identify BMP-3 and BMP-3b as novel antagonists in the BMP/TGF-β-signaling cascade, they do not give any clues as to how they might exert their effects.

[PAGE 2] 
In this study, we examine the mechanism by which BMP-3 antagonizes TGF-ẞ family ligand signaling in Xenopus embryos. We find that BMP-3 inhibits the mesoderm-inducing activities of both activin and BMP-4 by reducing the phosphorylation of R-Smads and that BMP-3 by itself is unable to activate BMP or activin R-Smads and thus does not signal using a TGF-ẞ pathway. Inhibition by BMP-3 can be overcome by activated BMP or activin type I receptors or by increased levels of ActRIIB. Finally, we find that BMP-3 binds to ActRIIB and that this binding cannot be competed by addition of excess activin. Our data support the hypothesis that BMP-3 is a novel TGF-ẞ family antagonist that acts by interfering with activin and BMP binding to ActRIIB, a type II receptor common to both signaling pathways. By using this mechanism, BMP-3 is able to modulate diverse developmental processes that are controlled by both activin and BMP signaling at the level of the individual target cell, providing the embryo with additional means to regulate these signaling molecules.

[PAGE 2] Materials and methods

Embryo assays and microinjection
Xenopus embryos were generated, cultured and staged using standard methods (Sive et al., 2000). RNAs were injected into the animal poles of 2- to 4-cell embryos or the ventral side of 4- to 8-cell embryos. 

[PAGE 3] Results
BMP-3 dorso-anteriorizes embryos
In previous studies, we showed that BMP-3 mRNA injected on the dorsal side of Xenopus embryos had mild dorsalizing activity (Daluiski et al., 2001), producing a phenotype opposite to that of ventralizing BMPs. To investigate whether BMP-3 might antagonize BMP or other TGF-B-like ligand activity, we microinjected ventral vegetal blastomeres of 8-cell embryos with BMP-3 mRNA and looked for secondary axis formation. Strong dorsalizing factors like noggin, chordin, follistatin or dominant-negative BMP receptors (tBR) mimic the activity of Spemann's organizer and cause complete axis duplication in this assay (Harland and Gerhart, 1997). 

[PAGE 4] 
The gain of function phenotypes we see are consistent with the expression of xBMP-3 in chordal mesoderm, notochord and cement gland in the Xenopus embryo (Hino et al., 2003). Together these gain of function studies suggested that BMP-3 might play a role in dorso-anterior patterning by effecting gastrulation movements during Xenopus development.

BMP-3 induces cement gland and neural tissue in animal cap explants
Next we tested the biological activity of BMP-3 in animal cap assays. When excised from blastula stage embryos, animal cap explants differentiate into epidermis. If the explants are treated with activin or nodal, they form mesodermal and endodermal tissues, while if exposed to BMP antagonists, they form neural tissue and cement gland (Harland and Gerhart, 1997). 

[PAGE 5] 
Our results further indicate that BMP-3 has biological activities in Xenopus embryos that are similar to factors that inhibit both BMP and activin signaling, but that BMP-3 differs from previously described antagonists in that it induces cement gland and neural tissue, but not secondary axis formation or endoderm.

BMP-3 blocks activin and BMP-4 mesoderm-inducing activity in animal cap explants
Using animal cap assays we tested the ability of BMP-3 to directly antagonize BMP and activin activity. When co-injected with RNA encoding BMP-4, BMP-3 was able to partially block the ability of BMP-4 to induce the expression of the early mesodermal marker, Xbra, as well as the ventral mesoderm marker, Xhox3.

[PAGE 5]
(Fig. 2J). Induction of only anterior neural tissue in animal
caps is a characteristic activity of BMP inhibitors (Harland,
2000; Weinstein and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1999). Interest-
ingly, BMP-3 appeared to induce this neural tissue directly,
as we did not detect any expression of muscle actin, a
mesodermal marker, even at high doses (1.5 ng) (Fig. 21).
Additionally, we saw that BMP-3 did not turn on the
expression of molecular markers of endoderm, such as
endodermin (Fig. 21) or Xsox17-ẞ (data not shown). Using
animal cap assays, we also found that incubation of
explants in BMP-3 protein resulted in the same phenotype
as injecting BMP-3 mRNA. Cement gland and neural
tissue were consistently induced when animal caps were
cultured in hBMP-3-conditioned media (Figs. 2D and H).
Our results further indicate that BMP-3 has biological
activities in Xenopus embryos that are similar to factors
that inhibit both BMP and activin signaling, but that BMP-
3 differs from previously described antagonists in that it
induces cement gland and neural tissue, but not secondary
axis formation or endoderm.

BMP-3 blocks activin and BMP-4 mesoderm-inducing
activity in animal cap explants

Using animal cap assays we tested the ability of BMP-3
to directly antagonize BMP and activin activity. When co-
injected with RNA encoding BMP-4, BMP-3 was able to
partially block the ability of BMP-4 to induce the
expression of the early mesodermal marker, Xbra, as well
as the ventral mesoderm marker, Xhox3 (Fig. 3A).
However, BMP-3 was not able to block the pro-epidermal
activity of BMP-4. Figs. 3A-B show that expression of
msx-1, a direct downstream target of BMP and a marker of
ventro-lateral ectoderm, and epidermal keratin remained
elevated in co-injected caps, indicating that BMP-3
interferes with the ventralizing activity of BMP-4 only in
the mesoderm. In contrast to noggin, chordin or tBR which
can rescue the BMP-4 ventralized phenotype in whole
embryos (reviewed in Harland and Gerhart, 1997), we
could not rescue ventralized BMP-4-injected embryos with
co-injected BMP-3 (see Fig. 7G and data not shown).
These results show that in Xenopus, BMP-3 is a weak
inhibitor of BMP when compared to other antagonists and
suggest that BMP-3 may be blocking BMP activity using a
novel mechanism.

We next investigated whether BMP-3 could antagonize
activin signaling. When BMP-3-injected animal caps were
incubated in activin protein, the morphogenic movements
indicative of mesoderm induction were blocked (Fig. 3C).
RT-PCR assays showed that BMP-3 strongly inhibited
activin mRNA and protein-induced expression of muscle
actin (Fig. 3D), indicating BMP-3 can antagonize activin
signaling as well as BMP signaling. Since our injected
BMP-3 mRNA blocks activin protein activity, this suggests
that BMP-3/activin heterodimers are not causing the effects
we see in our assays and is agreement with previous data
showing that activin does not form heterodimers with
BMP-4 (Wittbrodt and Rosa, 1994).

Finally, we wanted to determine if BMP-3 was acting as
a general inhibitor of mesoderm induction in Xenopus. To
do this, we tested the ability of BMP-3 to block mesodermal
marker gene expression activated by Xnr1 (Xenopus nodal
related 1), a TGF-β-like ligand shown to play important
roles in mesoderm formation in early embryos (Schier,
2003) and by bFGF, a protein implicated in inducing and
maintaining mesodermal fates in Xenopus (LaBonne and
Whitman, 1994; LaBonne et al., 1995). We found that
injection of BMP-3 could not block the induction of Xbra
by Xnrl supporting the previous findings of Hino et al.
(2003) (Fig. 3E). In addition, we saw that BMP-3 did not
effect the induction of muscle actin by bFGF protein (Fig.
3F). Our results confirm that in Xenopus, BMP-3 can only
inhibit a subset of TGF-B family signals, including
ventralizing BMP signals (BMP-2, -4 and ADMP) and
now reveal that BMP-3 can also antagonize dorsalizing,
activin signals.


[PAGE 6]
BMP-3 antagonizes activin and BMP signals upstream of
receptor activation

BMP and activin signaling are tightly regulated during
embryonic development by potent extracellular antagonists
that bind directly to these ligands, preventing them from
interacting with their receptors. Extracellular antagonists
can also inhibit signaling in an indirect manner, as has been
shown for BMPs and noggin, where the ligand upregulates
antagonist expression creating a negative feedback loop
(Amthor et al., 1999; Gazzerro et al., 1998; Nifuji and Noda,
1999). Existing data from our lab ruled out the possibility
that BMP-3 itself was an extracellular ligand antagonist
because we were unable to show direct binding of BMP-3 to
other BMPs or activin (Daluiski et al., 2001 and L.W.
Gamer and V. Rosen, unpublished). To investigate the
possibility that BMP-3 acts by regulating levels of known
extracellular antagonists, we assayed BMP-3-injected ani-
mal caps for the upregulation of noggin, chordin or
follistatin. BMP-3 was unable to induce expression of any
of these antagonists in late blastula stage animal caps, even
when injected at high doses (1.5 ng) (Fig. 4A).

We next investigated whether BMP-3 could block the
effects of constitutively activated type I activin or BMP
receptors in the animal cap assay by looking for induction of
mesodermal marker genes by these receptors. If BMP-3 acts
intracellularly by interfering with receptor activation, we
should observe a downregulation of mesodermal marker
expression. Conversely, if BMP-3 inhibits signaling
upstream of the receptor, marker gene expression should
be unaffected. For our experiments, we co-injected the
constitutively activated activin type I receptor (CA-ALK4)
or the constitutively activated BMP type I receptor (CA-
ALK3) with BMP-3 into both animal blastomeres of 2-cell
embryos. We then isolated animal caps and looked at the
effects on mesodermal marker expression by RT-PCR. We
found that BMP-3 was unable to block CA-ALK3 or CA-
ALK4 from inducing the expression of Xbra or muscle actin
(Figs. 4B and C). These data indicate that BMP-3 acts
upstream of receptor activation before R-Smad phosphor-
ylation by type I receptor.


[PAGE 7]
We then considered what receptor pathway BMP-3 could
use to antagonize both activin and BMP signaling. We
injected 4-cell embryos with BMP-3, BMP-4 or activin
mRNA and examined R-Smad phosphorylation in isolated
animal cap explants at stage 10.5. As expected, Western blot
analysis showed strong phosphorylation of Smad1,5,8 by
BMP-4 and phosphorylation of Smad2 by activin (Figs. 5A
and B). Surprisingly, we did not detect phosphorylation of
any R-Smads by BMP-3 alone (Figs. 5A and B, lane 3).
When we co-injected BMP-3 together with BMP-4 or
activin, we found that BMP-3 decreased the level of
phosphorylation of Smad1,5,8 and strongly reduced the
phosphorylation level of Smad2 (Figs. 5A and B, lane 4).
These results confirm that BMP-3 antagonizes signaling by
activin and BMP and identifies BMP-3 as an inhibitor of
signal transmission at the level of ligand binding to receptor.
Based on these findings, we also examined the effects of
BMP-3 overexpression on endogenous Smad phosphoryla-
tion in whole embryos. Here we found that BMP-3 strongly
reduced the level of Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) but
did not seem to effect Smad1,5,8 activation in gastrula stage
10.5 embryos (Fig. 5C). These data fit well with recent
antisense morpholino experiments by Piepenburg et al.
(2004), reinforcing the importance of activin signaling
through Smad2 for early mesodermal patterning. Our results
show that BMP-3 efficiently blocks endogenous activin
signaling by decreasing Smad2 activation but is not as
effective at blocking endogenous Smad1,5,8 phosphoryla-
tion. This may be due to the fact that BMPs can use both
ActRII/B and BMPR-II to transmit signals while activin
utilizes only ActRII/B. Therefore, if BMP-3 blocks signal-
ing at ActRII/B then BMPs may still be able to induce
Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation through BMPR-II. These results
led us to examine if BMP-3 interacted with ActRII/B.


[PAGE 8]
BMP-3 binds ActRIIB

Having established that BMP-3 blocks both activin and
BMP at the receptor level, the receptor targeted by BMP-3
would have to be one common to both the activin and BMP-
signaling pathways, most likely the type II activin receptor.
ActRII/B has been reported to bind multiple ligands
including BMP-2, BMP-7, GDF11 and activin (Massague
and Chen, 2000). To look for an interaction of BMP-3 with
ActRIIB, we co-expressed BMP-3 with epitope tagged
ActRIIB (ActRIIB/Myc) in early Xenopus embryos and used
the extracts of early gastrula stage animal halves for co-
immunoprecipitation assays. When we did this, we found
that BMP-3 was co-precipitated with ActRIIB by the anti-
myc antibody (Fig. 6A, lane 3).
Since BMP-3 and activin can both bind ActRIIB, it is
possible these two proteins compete for binding to their
common receptor leading to the inhibition of activin
signaling. To test this hypothesis, we performed binding
competition assays in early Xenopus embryos. BMP-3 was
co-expressed with ActRIIB/Myc in the absence or presence
of increasing amounts (2 ng, 4 ng, 6 ng) of activin/HA and
protein extracts of gastrula stage animal halves were
immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody. Fig. 6B shows
that increasing amounts of activin/HA did not significantly
decrease the amount of BMP-3 immunoprecipitated by
ActRIIB. The reverse experiment gave similar results with
increasing doses of BMP-3 unable to significantly reduce
the levels of activin immunoprecipitated by ActRIIB (Fig.
6C). Our data suggest that once BMP-3 binds the type II
receptor, it cannot be competed off by excess activin. These
results agree with our observation that animal caps
preloaded with BMP-3 cannot respond to activin protein
added later (see Figs. 3C and D). The interaction we observe
may reflect the ability of BMP-3 and activin to bind to
different sites on ActRIIB. Even if the two ligands do not
compete for the same site on the receptor, binding of BMP-3
precludes signal transduction by the activin-ActRIIB
complex. We did not perform these same competition
experiments using BMP-4 as BMP-4 is known to prefer
the type I receptor, and is unlikely to bind to type II receptor
in the absence of type I receptor in vivo (Shi and Massague,
2003).

We next looked to see how BMP-3 binding to type II
receptor affected the recruitment of type I receptor to the
receptor complex. To do this, BMP-3 was injected into
Xenopus embryos with ActRIIB/Myc alone or with ActRIIB/
Myc and the type I activin receptor, Alk4/Flag and protein
extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody.
We found that BMP-3 was able to make a complex
containing both ActRIIB and Alk4 (Fig. 6D). Our data
suggest this complex is inactive and prevents activin signal
transduction.


[PAGE 9]
To further evaluate and confirm our binding assay
results, we performed rescue experiments using whole
embryos in which BMP-3 mRNA was co-injected with
RNAs for various wild-type activin and BMP receptors. At
the late tadpole stage, embryos were scored for rescue to
normal development. In these experiments, only xActRIIB
rescued the BMP-3 phenotype back to proper body axis and
head formation in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 7B-D).
Co-injection of xBMPRII, a BMP-specific type II receptor
(Frisch and Wright, 1998) (Fig. 7E), xALK4, a type I activin
receptor (Chang et al., 1997) (Fig. 7F), BMP-4 (Fig. 7G) or
activin (Fig. 7H) as a ligand controls did not rescue the
BMP-3 phenotype at the doses tested. The discovery that
BMP-3 associates with ActRIIB along with the finding that
ActRIIB rescues BMP-3-injected embryos allows us to
conclude that BMP-3 blocks activin and BMP signaling by
binding to this common type II receptor. These results are

RNAs for various wild-type activin and BMP receptors. At
the late tadpole stage, embryos were scored for rescue to
normal development. In these experiments, only xActRIIB
rescued the BMP-3 phenotype back to proper body axis and
head formation in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 7B-D).
Co-injection of xBMPRII, a BMP-specific type II receptor
(Frisch and Wright, 1998) (Fig. 7E), xALK4, a type I activin
receptor (Chang et al., 1997) (Fig. 7F), BMP-4 (Fig. 7G) or
activin (Fig. 7H) as a ligand controls did not rescue the
BMP-3 phenotype at the doses tested. The discovery that
BMP-3 associates with ActRIIB along with the finding that
ActRIIB rescues BMP-3-injected embryos allows us to
conclude that BMP-3 blocks activin and BMP signaling by
binding to this common type II receptor. These results are
consistent with the observation that BMP-3 is a more potent
inhibitor of activin signaling (which uses only ActRII) than
BMP signaling (which uses both ActRII and BMPRII).

[PAGE 10] DISCUSSION

In this report, we use the wealth of information about the
activities of BMP and activin-like molecules in Xenopus to
explore the mechanism used by BMP-3 to modulate these
signals in the context of Xenopus development. Our data
show that BMP-3 is a dorso-anteriorizing factor that
antagonizes both activin and BMP-4 by binding to ActRII,
their common receptor, and interfering with signal trans-
duction. The interactions of BMP-3, activin and BMP-4 are
outlined in Fig. 8. When activin and BMP-3 are both present,
if BMP-3 occupies ActRII, activin is excluded, and an
inactive receptor complex forms that blocks Smad2 phos-
phorylation. As a result, activin signaling in target tissues is
diminished (Fig. 8C). This was shown in biochemical
binding and competition assays as well as in our animal
cap experiments, where BMP-3 prevented mesoderm for-
mation by blocking activin phosphorylation of Smad2.
When BMP-4 and BMP-3 are both present, if BMP-3
occupies ActRII, Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation cannot occur
through receptor complexes that contain ActRII (Fig. 8D).
However, since BMP-4 is not bound by BMP-3, BMP-4 is
able to activate BMP signaling through BMPR-II, allowing
BMP signaling in cells that express this BMP-specific type II
receptor (Fig. 8D). Evidence to support this idea is provided
by the induction of the epidermal markers msx-1 and
epidermal keratin when BMP-3 and BMP-4 are co-injected
into animal caps and by our observation that there is
Smad1,5,8 signaling in whole embryos overexpressing
BMP-3. Interestingly, our animal cap assays also showed
that BMP-3 could not block the activity Xnr1 (Hino et al.,
2003), a ligand that signals through ActRIIB/Alk4 and
requires an EGF-CFC co-receptor (Cheng et al., 2003;
Schier, 2003). Based on our results, we conclude the potency
of BMP-3 as an antagonist of TGF-B superfamily signaling
is greatest for ligands that act directly through ActRII.
While our data identify BMP-3 as a receptor antagonist,
there are additional ways in which BMP-3 might act to
inhibit activin and BMP signaling. One intriguing possi-
bility is that BMP-3 forms heterodimers with BMPs or
activin, creating dominant-negative ligands. This is consis-
tent with reports that injected BMP-3 can form heterodimers
with BMP-2 in Xenopus embryos (Hino et al., 2003). Our
animal cap assays show that BMP-3-conditioned media
(which contains only BMP-3 homodimers) have the same
biological activity as injected BMP-3 mRNA. We also
observed that injected activin mRNA cannot rescue the
BMP-3 whole embryo phenotype. These results suggest that
the BMP-3-antagonistic activity in our experiments is
unlikely to be due to heterodimerization between BMP-3
and activin. It is still possible that BMP-3/BMP-2/4 or
BMP-3/activin heterodimers could form in Xenopus
embryos and have their own receptor affinities that would
allow for selective inhibition of a subset of TGF-B mem-
bers. This is something we plan to investigate in future
studies.

[PAGE 11] 

Our gain of function studies with BMP-3 in Xenopus
embryos support the idea that the biological actions of
BMP-3 are due to its ability to modulate both activin and
BMP signaling through ActRII. Selectively blocking ActRII
may be an important way to affect specific developmental
processes. For example, overexpression of BMP-3 in whole
embryos causes the formation of enlarged and ectopic
cement glands. In recent years, a model has been put forth
suggesting that intermediate levels of BMP signaling in the
ectoderm lead to cement gland formation, while high levels
of BMP signaling promote epidermis and low levels of
BMP signaling result in neural tissue (Wardle and Sive,
2003). Our data lend support to this hypothesis, since BMP-
3 does not completely block BMP signaling, cement gland
tissue may be induced in embryos and animal caps because
of moderate levels of BMP signaling that may be occurring
through BMPRII. Additional support for this idea comes
from the fact that BMP-3 and BMP-4 are both expressed in
the developing cement gland (Fainsod et al., 1994;
Hemmati-Brivanlou and Thomsen, 1995; Hino et al.,
2003) where this regulatory interaction could take place.
In gastrula stage embryos, BMP-3 transcripts are found
throughout the marginal zone mesoderm where they appear
to overlap with the expression of activin (Dohrmann et al.,
1993; Fainsod et al., 1994; Hemmati-Brivanlou and
Thomsen, 1995; Hino et al., 2003). This co-localization
may allow BMP-3 to play a role in restricting activin in a
cell-specific manner, so that once BMP-3 binds to ActRII it
is unavailable to transmit activin signals, ensuring proper
dorso-anterior mesodermal patterning. In addition, BMP-3
expression overlaps with BMP-4 expression in gastrula
stage ectoderm (Fainsod et al., 1994; Hemmati-Brivanlou
and Thomsen, 1995; Hino et al., 2003) where BMP-3 could
act to decrease BMP signaling, allowing other BMP
antagonists that are expressed in Spemann's organizer to
successfully induce the full range of nervous system tissues.
The ability of BMP-3 to induce anterior neural tissue and
inhibit the mesoderm-inducing activities of both activin and
BMP support these ideas.

[PAGE 12] 

Although our gain of function studies indicate BMP-3
has a role patterning the Xenopus embryo, previously
reported antisense morpholino oligonucleotide experiments
for BMP-3 did not show any phenotype (Hino et al.,
2003). Since BMP-3 acts as an antagonist, it may need to
be ablated in conjunction with other activin/BMP inhib-
itors in order to determine its effects on embryonic
development as has been recently shown in triple
morpholino knockdown experiments for noggin, chordin
and follistatin (Khokha et al., 2005). It is also possible that
another highly related BMP family member (like BMP-3b/
GDF-10) compensates for the loss of BMP-3 in early
embryos, or that the role of BMP-3 in Xenopus develop-
ment may be temporally restricted to later stages. These
ideas are supported by data from BMP-3 null mice in
which the bone phenotype is first evident postnatally
(Daluiski et al., 2001) and from GDF-10 (BMP-3b)
knockout mice that do not have any obvious phenotype
(Zhao et al., 1999). Future studies that focus on the effects
of loss of BMP-3 in combination with other activin/BMP
antagonists may allow us to determine its full role during
Xenopus development.

[PAGE 13] 

Our current data regarding BMP-3 signaling in Xenopus
embryos agree with the work of Hino et al., 2003 who
reported that BMP-3 antagonized ventralizing BMPs but not
nodal-like ligands. However, our findings on how this
antagonism occurs in Xenopus need to be reconciled with
previously published observations in mammalian cell lines
where BMP-3 activated a TGF-β/activin-responsive reporter
and also inhibited BMP signaling downstream of the BMP
type I receptor (Daluiski et al., 2001). The most likely
explanation for these differences is that BMP-3 acts in cell-
context-dependent manner, similar to that observed for
inhibin which is an effective blocker of activin signaling but
only antagonizes BMP signaling in cell types that express
the co-receptor betaglyan (Wiater and Vale, 2003). Another
possibility is that the methodology employed in the
mammalian cell assays in which ligand and receptor
plasmids are transfected into unresponsive cells that are
then used for reporter assays is not as reliable as utilizing
Xenopus embryos that possess all of the signal transduction
machinery. This is certainly the true for assessing endoge-
nous Smad activation (Fig. 5), a more direct measure of
TGF-B-like ligand activity.
In conclusion, our data best fit a model in which BMP-3
interferes with activin and BMP-4 binding to the type II
activin receptor without activating R-Smads. As a conse-
quence, signaling through activin and BMP receptor
complexes that utilize ActRII is diminished. Thus, BMP-3
joins a growing family of TGF-β-like molecules including
inhibin (Wiater and Vale, 2003) and lefty (Chen and Shen,
2004; Cheng et al., 2004), which by virtue of their ability
bind to TGF-ẞ family receptors and co-receptors but not
activate signal transduction, serve as modulators of growth
factor activity during embryonic development.
