  "abstract": "We argue that \"processes versus objects\" is a useful dichotomy. There is, instead, substantial complementarity between them.  We explore this complementarity through the lens of the persistence through time of memory; the instability of observation and manipulation; the way we make sense of high-dimensional spaces and their potential features; and the inherent limitations of linear operators. Following Levin [204], we emphasize that memory, at first and foremost, is an interactive function, in terms of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) of Friston and colleagues [205, 206]. We consider the FEP as the basis for understanding the fundamental identity of both objects and processes, a holistic approach from which the idea of memory as a record of some level of accuracy, always contrived, and always misleading, and that science would be better served by abandoning it entirely.",
