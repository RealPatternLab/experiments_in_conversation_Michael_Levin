  "abstract": "Understanding the remarkable ability of some organisms to restore their anatomical shape following amputation of large portions of their bodies is a fundamental issue in regenerative biology and biomedicine. Despite rapid advances in the molecular processes required for regeneration, a systemic level algorithmic understanding of this process is still lacking.  A major challenge is to develop computational models that can explain how regeneration controls exactly what is missing, cell behaviors towards large-scale anatomical outcomes are largely unknown.",
