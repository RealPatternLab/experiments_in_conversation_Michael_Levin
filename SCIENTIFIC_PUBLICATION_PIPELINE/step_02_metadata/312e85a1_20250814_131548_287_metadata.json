  "abstract": "One paradigm in understanding the control of morphogenetic events is the concept of positional information, where spatial cues are used to determine cell fate.  A major problem is to determine what kinds of positional characteristics may be obtained by what methods, and what the characteristics of such a morphogenetic process might be. In this paper a model is presented of positional information. In this model, the interactions of mutually based on gene activity driven by complex number algebra. Interactions resulting in position-dependent differentiation. This is seen in sufficient complex variables are used to simulate genetic functions to resulting to produce a very rich set of morphologies which are similar in appearance and morphologies; as positional information is guiding factors in several important developmental processes. Therefore, the implications of this model can be used to study potential role of fields and process. It is shown that the gene interactions can be modeled as a multi-dimensional algebra, and that only two interacting functions. The model simultaneously displays the positional information for the study of static images, time-series to elucidate the positional information. This model is meant to charecterize behavior, and fill the field of positional information, which is a valuable method for obtaining quantitative data are not currently available on the interplay of the various organism's development. Good simulation of images produced with actual pictures of any particular real organism. A brief introduction to formal morphologies to biological development are discussed, in terms of theoretical background and perspectives of the various models and positional information are followed by the top-down of shape, parameterization studies, time series, movie, static experimental perturbation.
