  "abstract": "Many organisms can regenerate their bodies, but it is currently unclear how they accomplish this feat. In this paper, we introduce a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that allows a multicellular organism to dynamically maintain its shape in the light of random cell death, even in very heterogeneous environments. We present a novel agent-based model that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for planar and three-dimensional shapes, but the model is also capable of maintaining the shape of the biological organism.",
